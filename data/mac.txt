Meet Max! Mar 10 '02 (Updated Mar 10 '02) Author's Product Rating Product Rating: 5.0 Ease of Use: Quality of Tech Support: Pros Gee, it's an Apple Cons Help doesn't help me The Bottom Line What are you waiting for? You need this machine. But you can't have mine. Full Review I thought for my 200th review I should do something special. But I didn't. Here's to 200 more. Not long after Max (my iBook) arrived Ruin13's fiancée walked up to me and said "I hear you got a new iBook." I replied. "Yes! He's cute!" I believe this just confirmed his opinion of me as a slightly off center weirdo. Eh. Truth hurts more if you don't just accept it from the get go. Max is cute. He's all white and the little apple on his cover lights up when I have him on. Total strangers have cooed over him as if he were a particularly adorable baby and some of my friends are plotting getting one of their own. ~So what's so great about Max?~ First of all, he's a Mac. This translated into common tongue means that Max is super easy to run. Turn him on and he goes. Just like magic. I'm a junkie now. Sit me down in front of a PC and I'm apt to spent a lot of time cursing it when I can't quit an application with a simple keystroke or navigate Excel with one finger. Then there's all the cool stuff Max came pre-loaded with. There's the usual stuff, mail, Internet Explorer, Appleworks (a lesser word processing program with greater art capabilities than Word), Sherlock (which is a shortcut file finder), and Quicktime. Do PCs come with that stuff or do they figure they have you over a barrel after you spent less on the machine so they make you pay, what, $500 for Word? Thank you, sir, may I have another? Max also came with (for free and nothing) iTunes, iMovie, and iPhoto. ITunes is probably the easiest MP3 dealie on the market. It took me about 20 minutes to master it because I assumed it was more difficult than it was. I haven't played with iMovie yet and I haven't even loaded iPhoto because I'm still too enchanted with iTunes to be bothered. I have absolute faith that once I start playing with those applications I will be entertained for months after a short introductory learning session. (Should you have a Mac and desire iTunes for yourself go to: http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/ . Should you not have a Mac and desire iTunes, um, I'm sorry.) Max is packed with memory and charges up really fast. I'd tell you how much memory, but those numbers didn't mean enough to me to stick in my mind. It's probably enough for me to edit a 2 hour movie without having to delete my game. I did, however, run him down to nothing on his battery shortly after arrival and it took between 90 minutes and 2 hours to charge up. And there's one stupid Mac trick that makes me smile every time. When you click on a file to open it, it bounces while it's opening. Yes, it's stupid, but it never fails to bring a goofy grin to my face to see the iTunes icon bouncing up and down. And if you want to pretend don't have the most fun as well as the best machine going, there's a downlaod you can get to make it stop. You can also set the icons on the genius bar to magnify when you pass the cursor over them which is also a lot of fun, but gets in my way. ~The upgrades~ I didn't order the stripped down iBook. Oh no, I needed, required, could not live without DVD playing capabilities. And I'm actually impressed. I was afraid it would look like a big screen projection TV. It doesn't. The picture gets faded or darkened depending on how far off center you are, but the screen is only 9.75 inches wide, how far away did you think you were going to get? Three people could sit abreast and watch a movie without trouble. I also got (but don't tell my husband, it's a surprise for his birthday) a CD burner. Yes, inside Max's guts hides a CD burner. ITunes being the super simple process that it is, all you have to do to burn CDs is click a button. No, I'm serious. There's a button on the screen that says Burn CD. Click it and wait a few minutes. I think it took 20 minutes or half an hour when I tried it. ~What's not great about Max?~ Not much, but there are a few things. The speakers aren't so great, but I didn't expect much from a speaker the size of my thumb. The help section is nearly impossible for me to navigate. It sort of works like Ask Jeeves. You type in a question and it provides you with likely topics for your answer. I labor with the handicap of an English major so I know how to research and this kind of help just isn't helpful for me. I'm also not crazy about the mouse pad thing. I'd be happier if they just took that out and put in hole for a removable mouse. Steve, if you're paying attention, that's the only thing I really want. The only thing that truly bugs me is the color. (I'm such a girl that way.) I actually liked the colored clamshells. I'm sure Yoko Ono approves of the all white design, but I'm just worried about getting it smudged. I haven't taken the plastic cover off the battery thing because I want to keep it from getting banged up. So I guess there's another thing I really, really want. Color. Can you see Max with a nice sapphire blue case? He'd be really cute then. I recommend Macs to everyone except game junkies. There isn't much in the way of games and what there is comes out months after the PC version. I, however, find that to be a boon. If Max and the Blue Meanie could play lots and lots of wonderful games I would be forever playing games and never writing. The world would be poorer by 2 romance novels in the last 6 months alone. (Stop laughing, it is too a loss.) Get an iBook and discover how accessible computers can be. I must be off. I'm either going to watch my DVD of Earthquake or I'm going to finish that CD I started to assemble the other day. Or maybe I should be writing. The world needs more quality romance novels. PS  I feel I should share the origin of Max's name The original Blue Max is from the Brian Daley Han Solo adventures. Blue Max was a smallish computer, carried around in the chest cavity of a robot named Bollux. I will not be carrying Max around in my chest. I'm already carrying some vital organs there.

A nice blend of features, size, and performance Aug 06 '02 Author's Product Rating Product Rating: 5.0 Ease of Use: Quality of Tech Support: Pros Great design, Solid performance, Mac OS X easy to use, Nice Application bundle Cons No monitor spanning, newbies might not like support options The Bottom Line A versatile notebook with a great blend of features and software, with the design and ease-of-use of Apple. For PC users looking to switch - this is an ideal notebook. Full Review After several years away from the Mac, I've finally decided to return and try out the iBook. I'm currently using the May 2002 iBook 700 Mhz, 12.1" combo-drive model, and it's a great little notebook. Specifications: - 700 Mhz G3 Processor, 512K L2 cache - 128 MB ram standard, 384 MB as reviewed - 20 GB HD, 8x8x24 CD-RW/8X DVD Combo drive - 12.1" TFT-LCD display, capable of up 1024x768 resolution - ATI Radeon Mobility grahpics with 16MB VRAM - 2 USB, 1 Firewire, 10/100 Ethernet, 56k modem, A/V port with S-Video/Composite and VGA output, earphone port - Internal Airport (802.11b wireless) slot First Impressions: When I first opened the box, and took out everything, I was pleased with the layout of everything, and it took seconds to get everything out. You can see that Apple takes great care in the layout and presentation of everything they do. I looked at the manual and found it to be a very short one (about 40 pages), with numerous graphical illustrations showing the basics of where things are on the iBook, as well as a brief overview of OS X and the main applications such as Mail, iPhoto, and iTunes. I went ahead and just plugged the power adapter into the outlet and the iBook, turned it on, and about 2 minutes later, OS X appeared right on screen. So far no problems. Usage: The iBook is an extremely well-built notebook, and runs very well. Don't let the 700MHz fool you, it is very "snappy" and is enough processing power for most tasks, even the occasional Photoshop should be fine. It runs all preinstalled applications well, and OS X is an extremely stable OS. Built on BSD Unix, it allows the freedom for beginners to use OS X without the terminal, and for advanced users to launch the terminal and get straight into all the Unix stuff. Either way, the stability is incredible; I have run many applications at once, and the system doesn't crash. If, by chance, one of your programs does freeze, a control-apple-escape key combination (similar to control-alt-delete in Windows) will bring up a force-quit screen where you can quit the misbehaving program. I did find that running several apps can cause the system to become slower, but this is due to a lack of RAM. When I upgraded the RAM to 384MB, I found that multitasking became much smoother, and all applications open in 1-2 "bounces" now, versus the 5-7 bounces with 128MB. The Radeon Mobility graphics is a welcome addition, as the 16 MB of ram will help the more graphics-intensive applications. In addition, this allows the iBook to take advantage of Quartz Extreme graphics acceleration in Mac OS 10.2 (Jaguar) coming out late-August. 20 GB of hard drive space should be plenty for most consumer and student uses, and the combination CD-RW/DVD drive. If you need more space, you can customize one with 30GB or 40GB at the Apple Store online. After running the iBook for a while the area to the left of the trackpad becomes quite warm, as well as the left half underneath. Not hot enough to cook anything on, but it does get a bit warm. I find that it's much warmer when the AC adapter is plugged in... when it's runnning on the battery it is just a little warm, and not very noticeable. There are several little features on the iBook which are very nice. For example, there is a button on the battery you can press which allows you to check the battery life, and 4 lights indicate the battery status. In addition, when you put the iBook into sleep mode by closing the lid, the area to the left of the latch begins to pulsate a white glow, as if it's breathing (Oh my!) which is pretty cool. It has excellent battery life, under normal use you'll get a solid 4 hours(if not more) out of a fully-charged battery, while watching DVDs you'll probably get closer to 2.5-3 hours, still enough for those long movies. Applications: The iBook comes loaded with its own suite of imaging and audio applications: iPhoto for importing/basic editing of photos, iTunes for organizing and playing mp3 music, and iMovie for editing your own movies. All of the programs are well laid out and show off the ease of use with which Apple takes care to put into each of their products. iPhoto makes it quite easy to store and organize your digital photos. The recently updated iTunes will burn mp3s from your audio CDs, organize them and even create "Smart Playlists" that allow you to choose a couple options and automatically make a playlist based on your selections. It also features a rating system to help make it easier for you to get your favorite tunes. Although I don't use digital video, iMovie will help you to edit movies, place in transitions and other effects into your movies easily. In addition, it comes with Appleworks, Apple's basic office suite with a word processor, spreadsheet, database and presentation program. While it's no Microsoft Office, it'll get basic office tasks done, and you can always purchase Microsoft Office for OS X if you find that Appleworks doesn't suit your needs. For internet use it comes with AOL, Internet Explorer, Quicktime, and an e-mail application. Quicktime has been recently updated to version 6, and is a very nice program that supports the newer MPEG-4 open standard as well as "Instant on" streaming for movies that have been enabled with this functionality, so you can skip to any part of a movie streamed from the Internet without any delay. It's built in Sherlock tool allows you to search the Internet, look up products in stores, search the news, as well as Apple's support sites all from one application. To round things out, it has World Book Encyclopedia, as well as three games: A nicely designed Chess game, Otto-Matic, and Deimos Rising. For developers, OS X also comes with free Developer tools which allows you to create your own Carbon and Cocoa OS X programs in Objective-C as well as Java. One thing I've found very nice with OS X is the basic installation proess for most programs. To install a program, simply open up a disk image, and drag the contents into the Application folder. To uninstall, simply select the item and drag it to the Trash and empty it. It can't possibly be any simpler. Gripes: - Monitor spanning. The iBook only allows for video mirroring at resolutions up to 1024x768. It would be really nice if spanning was enabled on the iBook. Right now, only the more expensive PowerBooks supports spanning. - PC card slot. While not necessary because of bult in modem/ethernet as well as Firewire and USB ports and an Airport slot, it would have been a nice addition for expandability. - Support options. For some this may be important. It comes with a one year parts/labor warranty, but phone tech support is only for 90 days, afterwards it's $49/incident unless you buy Applecare ($249) that extends your warranty to 3 years parts/labor and 3 years phone support. While some may find this as a lack of support, the users in the Apple support forums as well as various Mac forums on the internet are very enthusiastic about Apple, and it's not very hard to get advice online. Conclusion Overall the iBook is an excellent notebook with just about everything you need. With a fairly fast processor, ample hard drive space, a combo drive, the stability of Mac OS X as well as Apple's easy to use programs, it's a well-rounded notebook. Whether you go with the 12.1" screen that's 5 lbs, or the 14.1" screen at 6 lbs, it's something that you'll take around everywhere, and it looks great as well. My only suggestion would be to upgrade the RAM to 384 MB, as it can get a bit sluggish with only 128MB. If you're a PC user looking to switch, take a definite look at this notebook. It's arguably the best priced offering from Apple, and it will satisfy most people's needs. Recommended Yes
My first and favorite lap top! Dec 02 '02 (Updated Dec 08 '02) Author's Product Rating Product Rating: 5.0 Ease of Use: Quality of Tech Support: Pros Ultra: portable, light, friendly, space-efficient, novice/intermediate laptop, crisp and colorful image, ROCKS!!! Cons Maybe a little expensive but well worth it. The Bottom Line For basic needs (word processing, burning CDs, watching DVDs, spreadsheets, Internet, games, photo shop, making movies), I got it all in my lap! Just me and my G3! Full Review I remember the day I got my iBook. The box was so cute that I didn't even want to open it. Once I did, I found a stylish laptop waiting to be explored and put to use. However, I was afraid to touch it. I just wanted to admire its beauty, its style, and imagine the things I could do with it. I ordered my iBook via www.apple.com prior to the end of 2001. This was before the 14" screen came out and before the 700 mhz G3 processor was out too. I built my iBook to have a combo drive (DVD/CD-RW), 384 MB (256 MB was standard), and 30G hard drive space (20G was standard; the 30G option gives you 27.85 G for your personal use after the other space is given to internal programs.) Cool things about this laptop: Weighs 4 lbs. and doesn't need any additional hardward that you snap on or off... Has sleep mode so once you open the laptop, it automatically is ready for you to use - no time wasted for the computer to reboot Very sleek and stylish that you turn heads at the Barnes and Noble coffee shop when writing up a storm! Absolutely portable everywhere; fits in your backpack, suitcase, underneath your car seat, and you can even store it on your bookshelf. Easy controls on a keyboard for volume and bright control Everything you need is in the box, except a detailed owner's manual. I don't know if this is necessarily a good thing, but I guess you get to know your iBook better through trial and error, experimentation, and just snooping around the computer. I used the iTunes program first as one of the reasons I got the lap top was to burn cds and take my library of music everywhere I go. The sound system is actually beyond decent for a laptop, filling up my room and audible throughout my apartment. Hook it up to some iStix or Sony speakers and you have a great jukebox! The burn program is super easy that you can begin making cds once you load up all your music you want. Even though the world uses MicroSoft for word processing, database, spreadsheet and power point presentations, Apple has the same programs Apple-style with AppleWorks. AppleWorks lets you translate MicroSoft files such as Word and Excel to use on the Apple computers as well as save your created AppleWorks files as MicroSoft Word or Excel. Of course, you lose some meaning in the translations (as in any language), but you can work on the same file back and forth. (I did take the MicroSoft demo for Apple and it was very colorful and busy..so much more than the MS package you use in the office. It was more of a turn off but it really looked sharp!) I was concerned that the 12 inch screen would be small and difficult to work off of; but quite contrary. I think it is the perfect size, great for everything I do on the iBook - even watching movies. The colors are vibrant and all the fonts and icons are alive. I can't believe this is a lap top! If everything could look this awesome. The computer comes with its power cord (that can be used in a variety of ways), a very very basic manual, a warranty booklet, and back up compact disks for rebooting your computer if you wanted to every start fresh. It also comes with a test disk to run checks on your iBook every now and then. I find the keyboard to work extremely well, but if my hands were any bigger, I would probably feel arthiritic after a couple of hours of typing. Mouse pad takes a bit getting use to but once you get the hang of it, easy to guide your cursor around. Every iBook comes with a 1 year warranty and 90 day tech support; you can purchase extended warranty for 3 years, which includes tech support. Any time you need help, call 1-800-MY-APPLE and get the help you need. I have had my computer for close to one year now, and I had a few keys on the keyboard stop responding. Because I was in warranty, Apple quickly sent a box to put my iBook in and send it for a repair. Quicker than I could say "I miss my iBook," I had my computer back. No shipping costs came out of my pocket. No fees to repair (got a new keyboard) and the best customer service anyone can receive - I found that I could rely and have peace of mind with buying this computer and with Apple. I have always loved Apple products and I knew my first computer was going to be one. I was actually in the market for the iMac but I totally fell in love with the iBook when I first saw it. As a creative writer, I wanted the flexibility of taking my lap top anywhere to catch those inspiring moments! One thing that I think may be exaggerated in the specs is that the battery can last up to 5 hours. I think I may have had four hours just using games or word processing, but add in DVD or iTunes, depending on the volume and light (brightness) intensity, battery power can reduce quickly. Usually for a movie, I have had success with close to 2 hours. I am sure there is still more to learn about this excellent product (I am still exploring) and I become amazed that I extremely happy with my purchase. It's easy for me to say switch from Windows because I've never cared for it since it is a rip off of Apple in the first place. But I certainly can recommend anyone to try it. Eating the real thing is better than glass. You may eventually have to buy some manuals to get to know your iBook, but it will be well worth the knowledge and experience to handle such a fantastic piece of technology. There is really so much you can do. And you can always go to www.apple.com to update the latest downloads to upgrade your software. Apple even has a great built-in network of users to get together at the site. I wouldn't want anything else than my iBook! Recommended Yes
Power and Privacy Aug 16 '02 Author's Product Rating Product Rating: 5.0 Ease of Use: Quality of Tech Support: Pros Keeps Microsoft's snoops away, beautiful power, CD-RW, DVD, great software Cons More power than necessary for beginning computer users The Bottom Line The iBook G3 offers the best of the Mac experience: power, ease of use, and respect. Why go with the snoops at Microsoft? Full Review I got my first iBook just a few weeks ago to use in my consulting business. I travel all around the country conducting interviews and psychological analysis, and so I need to enter information, write reports and give information on the go. Internet accessibility wherever I happen to land, as well as multi-media hookup, is also necessary for me. I couldn't be happier with the iBook. First of all, a note on numbers: most Windows computers have Pentium chips with high clock speeds (the Megahertz you're always hearing about), but what those computer makers don't tell you is that Pentium's business plan includes producing the highest clock speeds possible, no matter what. Their idea is that ignorant consumers would only pay attention to the clock speed number, and not wonder at all about how well the computer actually performs. Pentium's PC chips turn out to be quite inefficient. The upshot is that although most PCs are running at just a bit above 1000 megahertz and my iBook is running at 700 megahertz, my iBook actually performs faster. All of Apple's Macs are sold with the new operating system X these days, and my experience with it has been nothing but grand. It does all the things that Windows XP does, without any of the awful system incompatibilities problems that XP has become infamous for. OS X also has a lot of nice little perks, like the function that allows the user to create a PDF file from any file in any program. A lot of folks worry about transitioning their old operating system 9 software to OS X. I was too, but was pleasantly suprised to find that the computer automatically starts operating system 9 whenever I ask it to open a document or application that's native to the old operating system. The battery power on my iBook is very solid and predictable: about 6 hours for one battery, as long as I'm not watching a DVD. Then it's a bit shorter, maybe four hours. As for portability, well, all laptops are portable, but very few are as eye-catching as the iBook. I've noticed there's a kind of panache to having one in firms that deal with the more creative side of business: advertising firms are filled with them. Far and away the top reason I had for buying an iBook instead of a Windows XP computer is that I don't much want to be spied on. Unfortunately, Mr. Gates and his minions over at Microsoft appear to be up to their old tricks. Windows XP requires users to sign up for the Microsoft Passport, which tracks people as they use software, request customer support, and worst of all, as they surf the Internet! In order to use a Windows XP computer, you've got to agree to let Bill Gates collect information on practically everything you do on your computer. Thanks, but I don't want to go there today. That's just one of the many insulting new features of Windows XP that has persuaded me to go with Apple and buy an iBook. It's not just about user-friendliness. It's about respect for my privacy.

A great notebook for work and play Jul 22 '02 (Updated Jul 22 '02) Author's Product Rating Product Rating: 5.0 Ease of Use: Quality of Tech Support: Pros Lightweight, long battery life, full-featured Cons Crippled video output, region-specific DVD player The Bottom Line The iBook is a winner - whether for business, for home or for school. It's a computer that lets you do work, and lets you enjoy working on it. Full Review This article is written completely in Appleworks 6.2.4 on Mac OS X 10.1.5, on my iBook. Making The Switch There are very few items that inspire unbridled technolust in me. These are generally items that marry good technology with beautiful design. The first one was Psion Series 3a (1994), the second one Palm V (1999), and now the iBook. I had my eye on the iBook since it first came out in May 2001. However, back then I could not justify the purchase to myself. In time, the iBook kept looking better and better with the gradual upgrades. I finally caved in and made my decision to buy my own iBook in March. This is my first personal notebook, and my first personal Mac. What's in the box? Inside the well-designed box of goodies, Apple has thrown in : - The iBook (of course!) - Power adaptor - VGA adaptor cable - Modem cable - 10 CDs (software restore and applications) - A very thin & skimpy manual. It contains just a couple of pages on the iBook itself, the rest is on OS X and bundled applications - warranty etc. - A pair of white apple stickers - 1 blank CDR Look, touch and feel The iBook is definitely an attention getter. I have used it in public places and every time, people will look at it and ask about it. A white notebook is still considered a novelty where I am. Something about the iBook just begs you to hold it! It's very easy to get fingerprints on the white polycarbonate casing, however it's equally easy to wipe off. I really encourage potential buyers to hold it in their hands, look at the screen and type on the keyboard. While it was perfect for me, some people might feel the screen is too small . The compact form factor is a definite plus for me. Unlike other traditional budget laptops, this one actually feels right on your lap. It's also great for people travelling in coach (economy) class on airlines. All of the expansion ports (ethernet, modem, USB, firewire, VGA, audio out) are lined up on the left side of the iBook. While this looks neat, it has caused problems for people using USB mice, since the cable's not long enough. The keyboard has a good feel and travel. The keys are full size, and are white with black text. Only time will tell whether the keys will rub off. The screen is beautiful, very bright and crisp. It's very sharp at 1024 x 786. While it's capable of supporting lower resolutions (640 x 480 and 800 x 600), the result is disappointingly blurry. Under the hood OS X's Aqua user interface is the best-looking, most elegant desktop I've seen on a personal computer since NEXTStep all those years ago. I booted into OS 9.2 just for kicks. The familiar desktop now looks clunky and ugly to me. Windows XP, and all of its previous iterations pale in comparison. After a week using of Mac OS X, my PC desktop's Windows 98 felt very difficult to use. Even with the standard 128MB RAM, Mac OS X is surprisingly snappy. However, when I added an extra 256MB RAM, there was a definite boost in performance. Mac OS X is built upon Darwin, an open source Unix (BSD) clone. It's refreshing to have a stable, powerful Unix OS pre-installed on a notebook computer. No more fiddling around trying to get Linux up on my PC! Apple bundles a lot of applications and utilities familiar to Unix users, including the Apache web server, perl and the venerable vi editor. Apple Developer tools is also included on the hard disk, but not on a separate CD. It includes AppleScript Studio, Project Builder, Interface Builder and gcc compiler. My advice is to look carefully at the applications available on your iBook when you first get it, before playing around or repartitioning it. Some of the bundled applications are not available on the restore CDs. It's all in the i's Apple bundles a good mix of home-grown and third party applications with the iBook, allowing you to get productive from the start. The triumvirate of iTunes, iMovies, iPhoto are all you need to get started with multimedia. These are powerful, easy to use applications in their own right. Rip. Mix. Burn. The first application I tried was iTunes. On startup, it offered to search hard disk for MP3s. I got a pleasant surprise, Apple has thoughtfully bundled a good selection of songs on the iBook. The sound from dual built-in speakers are a bit tinny, but just on par on the notebooks I am used to. To test CD ripping, I put in an old Miles Davis CD. iTunes connected to the Internet to access the CDDB service. Moments later the CD was recognised and the song titles appeared. I clicked on import. It took roughly 20 minutes to rip the 55 minute CD. At the same time I was browsing the web, with no noticeable loss in performance. Next tried I the CD burning function. Since Apple conveniently included a free blank CDR with the iBook, I decided to put it to good use. I selected about 11 songs, and clicked Burn. 10 minutes later, I tried the new CD out on my home stereo. It worked flawlessly first the time. Movies and Images This is my first DVD player ever. When i inserted my DVD, an icon appeared on my desktop and the DVD player automatically loaded on the Dock. It offered to change my region settings, and reminded me that I can only change a total of 5 times. I personally think that region-specific DVD players are a nuisance. Why does it matter where you buy your DVDs? In this day and age, I am as likely to buy a DVD from Los Angeles as Bangkok, Thailand. iPhoto came on a separate CD, so I had to install it. Not having a USB scanner, I loaded up a CD with my baby pictures. iPhoto has a simple user interface, which allows you to organise photos and do minor editing. Office Productivity As mentioned above, this article is written in Appleworks. An all-in-one program, you can create word processing, spreadsheet, database, drawing, painting and presentation. While a lot of people swear by Microsoft Office, Appleworks has 70-80% of the features that everyone uses. It's also file-compatible with MS Office formats (able to read and write Word and Excel natively), HTML, text, and even PDF! In fact, any application that can print on OS X, can save files as PDF. This means you no longer have to buy a very expensive copy of Adobe Acrobat if you just want to share a file or two. The Internet The iBook can connect to the Internet via modem, LAN or Airport (WiFi / 802.11b). With an Airport card installed, the iBook allows truly portable computing. My local Starbucks has a wireless hotspot which I frequently visit when I need a fast Internet connection. The little things It's clear that Apple puts a lot of attention to detail. There are features on the iBook that you can't quantify in terms of dollar value or productivity increase, but will make you smile every time. For example: - The white Apple logo on the lid lights up whenever the iBook is on. I didn't notice this until someone in a cafe pointed this out to me. - When you put the iBook to sleep, a glowing light appears near the cover latch. This is not an LED, but a soft, pulsing light that makes me think my iBook is purring in its sleep. - The iBook also wakes up instantly from sleep. A second after opening the lid, you're ready to work. This feels like i'm working on a PDA. - There are LED charge indicators on the battery. This enables you to see at a glance how much battery life you have left, without having to switch on the iBook. - The VGA adaptor and power cable come with little plastic covers to protect the connections. This is a nice touch, but I don't know how long it will be until I lose them! It's truly amazing how many things just work with the iBook. All in all, this makes a truly enjoyable computing experience - something I've never thought I'd say! While Apple's hardware offerings tend to be pricey, the iBook range represents tremendous value for the cost-conscious buyer. Recommended Yes
Stylish, capable, durable, great. Jan 06 '02 Author's Product Rating Product Rating: 5.0 Ease of Use: Pros looks great; excellent features; wakes from sleep instantly; good value Cons AC adapter cord doesn't wind up nicely; mouse plugs into left side. The Bottom Line Small, stylish, and highly capable, the iBook is a great buy. I'm very pleased with my 500MHz model, and the 600 MHz version is even better. Get one! Full Review I bought a "dual USB" (white) iBook soon after they came out. I also added 256MB of memory to the standard 128 MB, bringing the total to 384, a very worthwhile investment especially if you are planning on running OS X, which you should. (The iBook has one memory expansion slot, which can accept a 512MB low-profile RAM chip, so you can have up to 640 MB. Six months ago that was prohibitively expensive, but now you should seriously consider it). Although my wife is a long-time member of the Apple faithful, I've always used Windows and unix, and I pretty much ignored the Mac platform until Mac OS X came out last year. But the combination of a modern OS and some excellent hardware caught my attention and I decided to give Apple a try: I bought an iBook. The iBook ships (as of early 2002) with both OS 9 and OS X; I use OS X exclusively, and I think I've only booted into OS 9 twice, so I can't really comment on software issues (if any) related to OS 9. One thing that is hard to convey is how stylish the iBook is. I pulled it out last night to look up something on the web (wirelessly), and my dinner guests all exclaimed "ooh" and "wow"...just because of how the machine looks. The slim profile, bright high-resolution screen, and glossy/matte white color scheme make a striking impression. As I mentioned, I never owned a Mac before, but set-up was a breeze. In OS X, almost everything that can be adjusted is accessed through "System Preferences", which can be launched from the menu bar no matter what application you're running. All I set initially was the date and time, and a few options for mouse speed and such, and I was good to go. Even connecting to the internet was a breeze---I unplugged my ethernet cable from my computer at work and plugged it into the iBook, expecting to then have to set I.P. addresses, various options, etc., etc. Nope, it just worked. The iBook comes with a large trackpad and a single big button. It took a week or so to get used to the trackpad---at first I would occasionally let a thumb rest on it or near it, which would make the cursor jump around. I don't even think about it now, it just doesn't happen anymore. Before I got used to the trackpad, I bought a small USB mouse. The mouse that I bought has two buttons and a scroll wheel, but somewhat to my surprise it worked with no problem as soon as I plugged it in, with no need to install a driver or anything. Kudos to Apple for making this easy. (I no longer bother with the mouse, haven't used it in a few months). The mouse does raise one of the two issues that I listed in the "cons" for this computer---and it's really a quibble. The somewhat unusual hinge on the iBook, which lets the screen pivot an extra inch away from the user than a conventional hinge, prevents the back of the computer from being used for ports and plugs. Instead, Apple put all of the ports (two USB, one firewire, one video output, modem, and ethernet) on the left side of the computer, and the CD (or DVD) drive and power plug on the right side. That means that if you want to use the mouse with your right hand, you have to loop the mouse cord around behind the computer, which is inconvenient if you have a short-ish mouse cord and can occasionally make the cord interfere with the CD tray, although the level of "inconvenience" this causes is so minor that it's barely worth mentioning. The keyboard took a little getting used to: it's perfectly flat and the keys are very slim. At first I used to plug in a friend's spare USB keyboard, which had a normal slight angle to it, and conventional keys. Now, though, I'm so used to the iBook's keyboard that I actually prefer it, or maybe I just don't care...at any rate it doesn't bother me. When I bought my iBook, I also got an "airport" card for about $100. "Airport" is Apple's word for a wireless standard that can also be used by Windows machines. Having the card doesn't do you any good, of course, unless you also have a wireless network of some kind (either another computer with an Airport card, or, much better, a base station). Rather than buy Apple's base station, my wife and I spent about the same amount for a wireless web router. That did take a bit of configuring---keying in some addresses and such, following the directions from our internet service provider---but it only took about 20 minutes. I highly recommend setting up a wireless network in your home, whatever kind of laptop you buy: it has changed my usage habits in ways I would not have expected, and I love it. Combined with the fact that the iBook wakes from sleep instantly (or within three seconds, anyway), it makes the computer useful much more often than you'd think. For example, if my wife and I are eating dinner and are thinking about seeing a movie, I just grab the iBook, open it up, and I can search for movies and times. I often check email (in about 20 seconds) just before leaving the house so I know what to expect when I get in to work. I can lie in bed and send email at night. And so on. Now, we finally get to the only thing that I _don't_ like about the iBook...the only thing that seems like a design oversight. And that issue is...the cool-looking mushroom-shaped AC adapter has a nicely designed storage slot where you can wind up the DC part of the cord (the part from the adapter to the computer), but there's nothing much you can do with the five-foot-long AC cord (from the wall socket to the adapter). I always try to kind of wind it around the base of the "mushroom", but the cord ends up just flopping around loose. A few things I have appreciated about the iBook: 1) Wireless home network is great to use; 2) Good battery life (about 3.5 hours in my experience) is enough to keep my occupied on most of my plane flights; 3) On a recent cross-country flight I rented a DVD movie in the airport terminal, then mailed it back when I got to my destination...is this a great country, or what; 4) iBook is very durable, I toss it in my knapsack or stick it in a barely-padded carry bag without a worry; 5) I've loaded about four hours of music onto my iBook, using iTunes, which is great during plane flights. And finally, a few words about OS X. I know that some long-time Mac users don't like the new operating system...I don't understand all of the issues, not having been a Mac user before, but I do know that OS X is the reason that I decided to give Apple a try. I'm a long-time unix user, and I use some unix tools on my iBook, and some unix-derived software. I have also come to like some of Apple's software (like iTunes and their Mail application), and I bought a couple of Mac games too. It's a great operating system. Sure, there are a few user interface kinks to work out (for instance, although the famous "dock" has its heart in the right place, it just doesn't work, and I have replaced it with a shareware replacement called Dragthing, which isn't perfect either), but overall it's the best OS out there. I have been very, very happy with my iBook. Recommended Yes
I switched! (the media hype got to me) Aug 28 '02 (Updated Aug 28 '02) Author's Product Rating Product Rating: 5.0 Ease of Use: Quality of Tech Support: Pros Smooth design, OSX, you can run linux apps on it, compact and light Cons Bad battery compartment design, the help is horrible The Bottom Line An excellent choice for anyone that is tired of Windows, afraid of Linux, or just wants a laptop that works. Full Review Make the switch Okay, I didn't totally switch. I still use my 2 PCs for work and play, but now I have a Mac to learn on and travel with. My old IBM ThinkPad finally crapped out, and I decided to take the plunge in the world of Apple. OS X - Two thumbs up! I had never considered owning a Mac. I thought MacOS was kinda neat looking, but slow and clunky compared to Linux or even the newer iterations of Windows. Plus, I was intimidated by the artsy-savant mystique surrounding the Macintosh line. I'm a Linux and Unix hobbyist (see some of my other reviews). When I heard that OS X would run on a kernel based on Unix, and still look pretty, I was hooked. The latest updated version of the OS runs fast, and so far, hasn't crashed on me. That's a bold statement, because I like to run lots of programs at the same time and push the machine to it's limits. So far, so good in the system stability category. The interface is very nice, with lots of eye candy. It's highly customizable and fairly easy to navigate. Since I'd never really used MacOS in the past, I was quite confused for a few days. Now I'm doing just great, having figured out where everything is, and how to make system adjustments. System as tested by me: 700mhz G3 256Mb RAM Combo Drive (DVD+CDRW) 12.1" LCD 20Gb HD What I liked about this machine: First of all, this laptop looks so damn cool. It just begs for attention. I'm glad that Apple didn't make the new iBooks in childish (but very fun) colors like the first generation. You could use this machine for professional purposes, and have people still take you seriously. Second, it's really amazing how small and light this thing is. No matter how many times I read the specs online, I still wasn't prepared for the ultra-compact size and feather-light weight. It's very travel friendly. (I can't wait to take mine on a business trip that's coming up soon. Now I can watch a movie on the plane!) What really blew my mind (As if everything else wasn't enough) was Apple's extreme attention to detail. For example, when the iBook is on and you lower the screen into it's locked position, the machine goes to sleep. Nothing new about that, right? Well, while asleep, the iBook shows you that it's on, but asleep via a small light on the front that slowly pulsates (as if it were breathing). It's that kind of detail that makes Apple hardware the top dog. There are lots of details I could share, but I don't want to ruin it for you. Discovering them is half the fun! The battery operates for about 4 hours during regular use. When watching DVDs, it's more like 3.25 hours. Not too shabby. It takes about 5.5 hours to completely recharge from zero. I did notice that turning the machine off and on (or rebooting - same thing) zapped 3% of the battery every time. And for some reason, MS Office V.X keeps the processor running at about 10% while it's the active application. This will make a big impact on the battery life if you plan on using Office a good bit while traveling. The software bundled with the iBook is quite comprehensive. I haven't really used most of it very much, with the exception of iTunes. The AppleWorks suite is similar to MS Works, but more robust. There are lots of cool utilities included as well, including a CPU monitor, which is one of my favorites. iTunes is a good program for listening to and cataloging music files, but I still think WinAmp is better. (Nullsoft has just released an alpha version of WinAmp for OS X.) What I didn't like: There's not a whole lot in this category, but here it is - The battery compartment is poorly designed. It's too easy for it to come loose, and it doesn't fit flush with the body of the laptop. I've tried to make it fit snug several times, and I just can't do it. The battery is released by turning a slot-type screw (you can use a coin for this). I noticed that this screw tends to loosen itself over time. This could be a bad thing if the batter popped out while you were traveling. The help is dismally scant. There were several questions I had that were completely unanswered by the help system. Luckily, Apple has a very good help section on their website. The manual that came with the iBook was also quite lacking. It was very aesthetically pleasing, but it really doesn't tell you how to do much. There is no manual for OS X either. I expected a much better documentation from Apple. All the I/O ports are on the left side. This is great for southpaws, but for the rest of us right handed folks it's an annoyance. When using a mouse, I have to either run the cord underneath or around the back, and this shortens the available cord to work with. I think it would have been better to have them on the back, as this would allow easy use for left or right handed people. It's not a big deal, but slightly annoying sometimes. The speakers don't have enough power for watching DVDs. This is really just a nitpick. Even in a quiet room, the speakers are not loud enough to really enjoy a movie. If you are going to watch a movie with the iBook, make sure you have headphones or externally powered speakers. Overall I highly recommend the iBook for work or play. It can handle a lot multi-tasking business apps, as well as playing music and games, and watching movies. I would suggest, however, that you get at least 256Mb of RAM for optimum performance. You can never have too much RAM. Even techno geeks can get a lot of use out of the iBook. With it's Unix compatibility and X-term (looking) console with tcsh or bash shell, you can do a lot of geeky configuration or even compile apps to run natively. Recommended Yes
A Small Wonder: Apple's New iBook Toasts the Competition Jan 02 '02 Author's Product Rating Product Rating: 5.0 Ease of Use: Quality of Tech Support: Pros Fast processor, great bundled software, small, easy to transport package, very versatile and user-friendly Cons Does not have the computer world acceptance the PC does The Bottom Line The iBook is a treasure. Don't buy a PC for the sake of fitting in. Instead, look into this little Mac and Think Different. Full Review Good things come in small packages. This cliché is a necessary element in reviewing the new iBook 600mhz. With its sleek gray-white chassis, zippy 100mhz front-side bus, and light sub-five pound weight, it is a wonder any portable computer advocate would not consider purchasing this fun yet serious laptop computer. In a simple phrase, the new iBook is a small wonder. I’ll be the first to admit it. Over the last ten years, I have been a PC guy. You know our breed. We salivate at the hint of a new Windows release, lovingly sigh at the rumor of a new upgrade to MS Office, and dream of the new toys Bill Gates has on his agenda. Ps’s, therefore, are the be all and end all of our productive lives. Recently, however, I’ve had an epiphany – the discovery of the newer, more improved iBook. There are a few things about the iBook that I find irritating. The convenience of a floppy drive, for instance, is something I sorely miss. That Macintosh is a successful producer of powerful operating systems and productive software proves their products are widely accepted by techies and the common simple surfers. But the availability of compatible software and hardware is just not as prevalent as with PC’s. Recently, I have been in the market for a cheap yet reliable digital camera. Most cameras in this category, however, are only PC compatible -- I have to search for a camera that is "Mac-Friendly." Why do we Mac-addicted consumers have to suffer this qualm while the billions of PC users can have their cake and eat it too? As frustrating as it may seem, though, the pros far outweigh the cons of the iBook. Every time I look at the closed chassis of my iBook, I get a sense of pleasure – the pleasure of knowing I own a fast and powerful machine capable of completing all my productive and entertaining tasks. The G3 600Mhz processor is fast. I run several productivity and educational programs along with the large array of stock software that Apple ships with the iBook (see www.apple.com for a full list of the software). With every task, the computer runs and executes with smooth precision – quickly, accurately, and without a stutter. The iBook comes standard with 128MB of RAM installed. This is plenty of RAM for most applications you would want to run. However, there is an empty memory bay that is not only easy to get to, but it is easy to insert a stick of PC100 RAM up to 512MB into the slot. I had an old stick of 64MB lying around from an old laptop, so I put it in, powered up, and was running faster than before in less than five minutes – it was that easy. The 192MB of RAM makes every task faster. The iBook comes loaded with MAC OS 9.2 and MAC OS 10.1. You can choose to run either OS, but OS X limits the software you can run in the OS X environment. The neat thing, however, is that OS X goes into "Classic" mode when you are running a non-OS X application, thus allowing you to run all of your old programs. You will need more RAM than the standard 128 to run OS X efficiently; with 192MB of RAM, it runs much better, jumping from application to application with smoothness and ease. With 256MB of RAM, this thing would probably break the sound barrier. Other than looks and speed, the iBook has much more to offer. On the left side of the keyboard and chassis, you find a neat array of plug in adapters. There is a high-speed Firewire port for those add-ons such as additional hard drives, scanners, digital camcorders, or any hardware devices that use Firewire. In addition, there are two USB ports, a video/audio out port, external monitor port, Ethernet, and modem connection. The iBook leaves no room for limits. If you can connect it, the iBook can accept it. The 12.1" active matrix screen is something most spoiled large-screen junkies wine about. That the iBook’s resolution goes up to 1024x768 allows the user full detail and millions of colors. The screen, although small at first glance, is really all you need to view the web, produce documents and presentations, and even watch you favorite DVD. Its compactness is a virtue – the iBook is kept small in scale and light in weight. When selecting my iBook, I had some decisions to make. Did I want a 30G hard drive or something smaller? Did I want a DVD, CD/RW, CD-ROM, or a combo CD/RW-DVD drive? I opted for the latter, along with a 20G hard drive -- plenty of storage with the ability to watch DVDs and burn my favorite tunes onto a CD-R disc. The drives work beautifully – DVDs play without a stutter, and with the ATI 128 video card and 8MB of video RAM, the movies don’t stutter or skip. A computer isn’t a machine of productivity and entertainment without a wide variety of bundled software. The iBook is no exception. With everything from Appleworks for productivity to Nanosaur and Bugdom for gaming, the iBook packs plenty of productive punch and easy entertainment. The only thing I purchased afterward was the Apple Teacher Productivity Kit. As an educator, I liked the idea of having a strong array of educationally centered software. The cost was minimal, but the software’s productivity was almost priceless. My experience with the Apple website and the purchase of my iBook was flawless. I researched, customized, financed, and tracked my order entirely through their site. I have yet to find a company with such a customer-friendly site. I guess that is what you get from a company that produces the user-friendliest computers in the world. What more can I say? As I write this Epinion, I sit in awe and perfect comfort with my iBook in my lap. It is just one of those fate-oriented decisions – you decide, order, and keep your fingers crossed that you made the right move. So far, purchasing the iBook is one of the best recent moves I have made. Even my wife doesn’t complain. To ensure safety, however, I bought her an iMac. That is another story in a different review.

Best computer I have ever owned Nov 22 '02 Author's Product Rating Product Rating: 5.0 Ease of Use: Quality of Tech Support: Pros fast, light, long-lasting battery, bright display, stable, beautiful to look at. Cons Little bit of trouble integrating with Windows network. The Bottom Line Using the iBook has been a dream, and after three weeks I now consider it the best computer I have ever owned. I can't imagine working without it now. Full Review This iBook is my first Mac. I come to it from the world of Intel/Linux, but I do use an iMac at work so this wasn’t much of a switch in the sense that I was quite familiar with the OS and the Mac hardware in general. The fact that the iBook runs OS X Jaguar also played a part in my decision to move to the Mac. Having used Windows 3.1 through XP, Mac 8.6 through 9.2, every distribution of Linux you can think of, as well as Sun Solaris and two flavors of BSD, I believe that OS X is one of the strongest, most stable, most usable operating systems I’ve ever encountered. Like almost everyone who buys a Mac for the first time, I took a lot of pleasure from the experience of opening the box and unpacking it. This aspect of the Mac experience caught me completely by surprise. I’ve never experienced it before, and I’ve bought a number of new computers since the mid-1980s. There really is no way to explain this except to say that the whole package is so well designed, so well put together, that even pulling out the power-adapter gave me a bit of a thrill. Go figure! Starting up the iBook for the first time was also a good experience, and within a couple of minutes I had OS X up and running. If you’re thinking of switching to Mac, or have never used a notebook computer before, there are probably a few things on your mind. I’ll try to cover the things I was concerned about before I switched. Speed — move from a mightily endowed 1.3 Gigahertz PC to a 700 Megahertz Mac? Battery life — I’ve only owned used laptops before, where the batteries were basically expired, so I had no idea what to expect in this regard. Relatively small 12.1 inch screen — Again, my PC has a 17 inch monitor, so I was a bit worried. Compatibility with Windows — I don’t use Windows much, but the rest of my family does, and I have to use a printer that’s connected to a Windows machine. I’ll address those issues one at a time. Speed. I’m not a Megahertz junky. To be honest, I can’t tell much difference between my 400 MHz PII, my 1.3 Gigahertz AMD Duron, or my friend’s 1.7 Gigahertz Athlon. In my experience, factors other than the CPU make a huge difference to the computing experience. For example, my 400 MHz PII rocked with a Voodoo 3 2000 video card. My 1.3 GHz machine did not seem to perform nearly as well on some applications, even though it had a 64 MB GEforce video card. Truthfully, on everyday applications like WordPerfect or Internet Explorer, I never noticed much difference at all. So the idea of buying a brand new iBook at 700 MHz, about half the speed of my AMD machine, didn’t bother me at all. The iBook performs well. CPU speed is not an issue. Battery Life — From full charge, using the machine constantly for writing, email and Web browsing, I get between 4.5 and 5 hours out of the battery, which is very impressive in my opinion. That means I can generally work through a whole evening or an afternoon without worrying about plugging the machine in. This is an extremely liberating experience for a long-time desktop PC user. To be able to compute anywhere! The longer battery life is possible because the iBook steps back its processor to 400 MHz speed while on battery only. Don’t worry, you can have it work at top speed all the time if you want, but if long battery life between charges is important to you, let the iBook decide automatically how it will behave. Small screen — Yes, it’s smaller than a desktop monitor, but it has never been an issue for me. I did look at the iBook with the larger screen (14.1) inch, but decided against it, not because of the cost (it was only a couple of hundred dollars difference), but because the darned thing felt flimsy! The smaller iBook with the 12.1 inch screen felt rock steady. No bendiness. It just felt... good. Solid. And the 1024-768 resolution is ample for my needs. I have used an older iBook at work with a resolution of 800-600, and this is far superior. Windows compatibility — This is where the iBook had a few problems for me. For all the hype of "It just works" and "Start working out of the box" there was an inordinate amount of tweaking to do to get the iBook to play nicely with my home PC network. Oh, Jaguar detected the other Windows shares without a problem; swapping files was not the issue. The problem was printers. My home network shared an older NEC Silentwriter2 290 Postscript printer hooked up via parallel port. The first problem arose because the iBook could not detect the printer shares at all on the Windows network. After I solved that problem working in terminal to adjust the Samba configuration, I learned that I could not print to the Silentwriter at all because it is a Postscript Level I printer. Jaguar can print only to Postscript Level II and III compatible printers. After much research, I learned about some Unix applications that could help (Gimp-Print and Ghostscript), and after installing them managed to share the printer without a problem. If I had not had a lot of experience with Linux and Unix, however, I would not have attempted this and would have ended up buying a USB printer to hook up directly to the iBook. Add-ons. I guess I must have been feeling particularly flush the day I bought my iBook, because I bumped the RAM up to 384 MB, purchased the 3-year AppleCare protection plan, as well as an AirPort Base Station and Airport Card. It’s been close to a month since I purchased my iBook, and I have not regretted the purchase even once. I have not yet used the AppleCare plan, and hope never to have to. The Airport and wireless networking, on the other hand, are now such an integral part of the way I compute that I could never go back to hard-wired computing! The Airport, by the way, integrated seamlessly with the Windows network. Three short postscripts. I have two Linux systems in the house acting as servers — one as a router/firewall for the Lan, the other as a file server. I ended up switching the Silentwriter to the Linux server and it is shared without problem by all systems in the house; I put an Epson C60 on the Windows box for the kids to do their colour printing. Both machines work well over the wireless network for the iBook, and both work well for the Windows machines. For those new to OS X, I’m sorry to say that the documentation that comes with the iBook is virtually useless. I ended up purchasing OS X Jaguar — The Missing Manual, which at $30 was a good investment. I’d recommend it highly to anybody new to Mac or to OS X. For Linux/Unix users, the terminal and shell will prove familiar territory, but the GUI can be a challenge if you’re not accustomed to it. I don’t blame long-time Mac users for being uncertain about switching to OS X. Lastly, something of interest to those who are weighing whether to purchase from Apple directly, or from an authorized reseller. Exactly four days after I purchased my 700 MHz iBook, Apple released the next generation, 800 MHz iBook. These look the same, but have a little more juice on both the CPU and video areas. What really shocked me, however, was that the price of the old iBook dropped by about $300 Canadian across the board! I visited the Apple site and learned that Apple had a price protection policy in effect for 10 days after an order is placed. I wasn’t sure that the reseller would honor the policy. I phoned them, they checked into it, and called back a short while later to inform me that they’d refund the difference. I told them I’d rather have a copy of Microsoft Office v. X instead, and they agreed, which was fine with both of us, I’m sure. All in all, I was very impressed with the service I received from the reseller. The salesman demonstrated good knowledge of the product and, even better, I got to play on the iBooks before deciding which one I wanted. Recommended Yes
Ideal for students Sep 16 '02 Author's Product Rating Product Rating: 4.0 Ease of Use: Quality of Tech Support: Pros Small size, mobility, decent power for the price Cons Lighter than most, but still heavy The Bottom Line Buy. Students will love the mobility and power iBook has to offer, unless you're a serious photoshop junky or a movie maker (then go for Titanium G4.) Full Review The Apple iBook has become more professional looking after they discontinued the fruit-colored line, which was both childish and weak. With the recent iBook line you get Apple's legendary sleek design with enough power to satisfy most users. Basic I say "enough" because if you're a superuser I'd recommend the G4 Titanium instead (which I think is too large to be carried around). The iBook is smaller than a regular sized binder and can be carried with one hand without much difficulty. It does not feature the handle that the old iBooks had, but most people probably don't mind. The ports are on the left side of the keyboard while the cd-drive and the power plug goes on the right. The left-handed ports was only a problem when I wished to plug my iMac mouse into it for graphical applications, and my mouse cord wasn't long enough. From the left, there's the 56k modem port, ethernet port, firewire, and two USB ports with another port for the monitor cable which comes with the iBook. Then there's the headphone jack... The headphone jack has both audio and video uses, so you will definitely hear a good deal of static if you're using the headphones. As I joke around with my friends, I can often "hear" my enemies before I actually see them on certain computer games. Keyboard Very smooth typing on white keys that can be detached from the main body in order to install stuff into the motherboard. The control and options key are only on the left side, which may pose problems for users used to that configuration. There's also the "fn" key that are needed for certain functions. Starting from the F1 key to the F6, you can activate with the "fn" key: Dimmer, Brighter (screen), mute, softer, louder (volume), and num lock keys. At times there will be a delay activating some of these keys but they work nicely. After much prolonged use, however, I've noticed that changing my volume causes this annoying static-y chirp to occur. Got used to it but... The F12 key is used to eject what's in the CD drive. CD Drive I have the CD-RW/DVD drive. The DVDs have played nicely thus far, and I've burned CDs many times. The speed of the burning, however, is only 4X, which is tolerable, but still lacking compared to many of the super-speed burners out there. I've often heard of the problems concerning combo drives, but I haven't had much difficulties with it except: While I'm burning a CD with a program such as iTunes, I noticed that turning on/off my halogen lamp in the same room causes the CD burn to abort because of certain interferences caused by my action. Lost many CDs until I found out what was causing the abortions, but CDs are pretty cheap anyways. Now only if time were cheap. And ya, there have been certain instances where I just simply could NOT burn files, but that could be avoided by using programs such as Roxio's Toast instead of the burning software that is built into the system. The CD drive is pretty noisy. Trackpad First trackpad I've used so it took quite a bit to get used to. If you're into gaming and graphics, you're better off purchasing an auxiliary mouse, for the pad is inadequate for either. Otherwise it functions well. Some other stuff: The apple logo on the top of the iBook lights up when you turn it on, and it changes according to how bright/dim your monitor is. Turns off when iBook is off or sleeping. When the iBook is sleeping, the little light at the bottom of the keyboard pulsates slowly, much like the G4 towers. Sleeps when you simply close the monitor, wakes when you open it up again. Speaker Decent, especially when you see that there are PCs out there who require these things called "sound cards" to enable sound, a concept unknown to Mac users. It's better than nothing, but if you need the hits of a large bass system for your heavy duty rap music, get yourself those spiffy speakers by Apple. Maintenance The top beautiful cover of the iBook is scratched up due to my carrying it in the laptop bag with insufficient protection. Be careful with your machines, you'll regret not having taken care of your precious baby. Noise of computer: Unless the computer is sleeping or shut down, it makes a good deal of CPU noise. From what I've read, Apple could not take noise into consideration while trying to fit all the components into such small a space. It's not life threatening. After enough inactivity the hard disk can also spin down and monitor can dim, causing the noise level to cease. Well the problem I'm noticing at the moment is all this gunk and hair that got trapped beneathe the keys on the keyboard which, upon close examination, looks quite irritating. Being white keys and all, the pile up of dust is more visible than on other machines. You can detach the keyboard and see what you can do with it, so far I'm not sure how I'm going to go about cleaning this. I've read at Apple website that you should use compressed air of some sort. Support Which brings up the next point. I've owned Macs since the 6100/66 (the PowerMac with the 66mhz processor) and also own a bondi blue iMac, a G4 tower, along with this iBook which I use on a daily basis. Thus far I've NEVER had to contact the Apple support phone line. I'm proud of the fact that I was able to fix 90% of my problems using the Apple Guide included in the system or the manuals that came with the computer. Sure, I've read virtually any and all Troubleshooting book on the Mac OS out there (until the release of OS X) but the Mac is nothing like the PC. None of that random blue screen that throws away all your work for no reason. Everything is intuitive! I'm a mac loyalist and damn proud of it. With good reason too. Especially with the OS X, which is the most stable OS I know. Individual programs have frozen up on me on some really long task, which caused me to force quit the application, but it's never crashed on me as a whole (except one really weird instance, but I overlook it). OS X is truly a beauty, and even my PC friends have to remark on how "cool" the dock looks. If nothing else, the Apple support website and forums are enough to solve ANY other problems you may have. Good thing with the Apple products is that unlike PCs where different components come from different manufacturers, most of what you'll use are Apple-made and they can provide you with all the support you need. Ruggedness Shame on me, but I have first-handedly tested the ruggedness of this machine. Well, simply by the looks you can deduce the toughness of the machine as well. But there was one instance where I, trying to carry the iBook with one slippery hand, happened to drop it onto hard concrete floor from about knee height. No visible scratches or damages to the system (except the popping out of the CD drive; easily fixed by pushing it back in). Had some emotional damage to myself as an owner... bad owner. I also carry the iBook in a laptop bag in which I carry other books and such, but often I (doh) forget I have a laptop in it and toss the bag onto some location. When at last I realize I have a 1600dollar machine in there I yell "crap" and check the condition of the iBook to see that everything's still intact (besides the occassional popping out of a CD drive). SYSTEM maintenance As a OS 7.5-9 user I've used Disk First Aid on a regular basis to rid the system of any evilness, but with the OS X that's not required. Upon startup the system automatically runs the First Aid program. Brawn My iBook has replaced my iMac as THE computer I use daily. The iMac is sitting there as slowly I take away its peripheral devices and hook them up to my iBook. Not the acclaimed G4 processor, but this will do for many things. I've made movies with the included iMovie, I've made lots of webpages using Dreamweaver and Fireworks, I watch DVD movies, I do basically all that you can do with a computer and have had no problem witht the power it offers. But from what I hear, the OS X interface is considerably faster on the G4 processor, and although I personally don't see much to complain about, it's recommended to use OS X on a G4. Recommended Yes
My Favorite Computer Jul 04 '02 (Updated Jul 04 '02) Author's Product Rating Product Rating: 5.0 Ease of Use: Quality of Tech Support: Pros Looks good, fast enough for everyday computing, great screen, good tech support. Cons Lack of PC Card slots The Bottom Line This laptop gets the job done in style -- highly recommended. Full Review I purchased my iBook (600MHz Dual USB) in January 2002, and I think it's pretty close to the best computer purchase I've ever made. I use it for everything, and I've found it's able to do everything I need it to do -- web development, photo editing, school work, and whatever else comes down the pipe line. The only upgrades I've given it are an Airport card and an extra 256MB of RAM (for a total of 384MB installed). The RAM is definitely needed for anyone who wants to do anything more substantial than word processing, and is especially nice when running OS X. I highly recommend buying RAM from a third party reseller, not from an Apple store (online or otherwise) -- you'll save a considerable amount of money. The iBook takes standard PC100 SO-DIMMs, just like PC laptops, so you can find the chips pretty much anywhere. Installation is a cinch, with graphical instructions located under the keyboard. The Airport card works flawlessly, and I often spend lazy afternoons surfing public wireless networks while sipping espresso in cafes downtown. The only potential downside is that people will stop to look at your laptop and ask you questions about it -- the iBook is a head turner. One major advantage the iBook has over other notebooks is that the Airport antenna is built into screen of the machine. I'm able to get better reception than most other systems I've tested this one against (including the original iBook, and Lucent PC Cards). I spend a considerable amount of time doing things that are somewhat CPU intensive: working with Photoshop, doing database/system/web programming, and other such things. I'm quite pleased with the performance, although it would be nice to have a little extra oomph for those large Photoshop files, and it wouldn't hurt to give the graphics chip a little boost. However, considering the laptop only cost a bit over $1500, I really can't complain. It's definitely got a whole lot of bang for the buck. One place where the iBook really shines is battery life. With the screen turned down low, and the CPU throttled (in OSX 10.1.5), I can easily spend five hours at the library writing papers before the battery goes dead. One really cool feature is that I can check the battery level while the machine is folded up and asleep -- the battery has a button and 4 status lights that can give you a rough idea of how much juice is left. I've been VERY happy with the general stability of this machine. OS X and the iBook work rather well together, and it's not uncommon for my laptop to go several weeks between reboots, and most of the time that's only because I've downloaded system updates that require a reboot. I've never had a program crash so hard the machine needed to be reset, and I've only had one instance of the machine not waking up from sleep (which was cured by unplugging and replugging the Ethernet connection). The only big problem I could see someone having is the lack of PC Card slots. However, considering that the laptop has built in 100Mb Ethernet, 56k modem, 2 USB ports, 1 Firewire port, and an optional internal Airport card, I've never had a need for a PC Card slot. All things considered, I love my iBook. It's a fantastic little computer that gets the job done, and looks good doing it. Highly recommended to anyone who doesn't need a serious amount of horsepower, or PC Card slots -- and for those who do, check out the G4 Powerbook! Recommended Yes
This apple is solid to the core Nov 25 '02 (Updated Dec 06 '02) Author's Product Rating Product Rating: 5.0 Ease of Use: Quality of Tech Support: Pros New user interface(OSX) based on UNIX, attractive and durable design Cons Should have more memory and an owner's manual The Bottom Line Simple to use and elegant this computer is for you. With a brand new operating system built from the ground up, I can only see positive things for this company. Full Review I was tossed back and forth from Bill Gate's and Steve Job's. Where and what is the future of the operating systems? Will software companies and those who provide peripherials for computer continue to support Apple? I'm convinced that the answer is unequivacally, yes. This conclusion was based on Macintosh's fairly new operating system OSX. When Steve Jobs was hired back by Apple he brought many of his ideas his formulated at NeXT to Apple. One of them was a system based on the rock solid Unix code. The most secure language in the world. It is virtually crash-proof. If he would of stopped there it would have been good, but he went further. He developed Quartz graphics(the beautiful desktop you see when booted), multi-threading, pre-emptive multi-tasking, and memory allocation/ protection. I'll explain these in a minute. On top of the operation system, which makes everything on your Mac run just a little better and smooth than previous systems, the iBook has many nice cosmetic and practical functions. Before I describe what I feel are some of the more prominent and noble features, let me recommend the iBook primarily to the consumer and not the professional. While it can run programs like Photoshop that require more processing power to render it's effects, it will dissapoint if you want peak performance from a laptop. Buy a powerbook instead. But, if you want a down-to-earth laptop with durability and modest features then this one's for you. 'Nuff said! Ok, the features: Practical OSX operating system based on UNIX(more on this later) DVD/ CD-RW combo drive: If you are going to buy one these laptops, go all the way and get the combo drive. It will cost a few hundred more than the base model, but you will get better graphics, more harddrive and of course, the drive unit itself. You will be beating yourself over the head many times over if you don't because these drives work beautifully and are integrated to function seamlessly with some of Apple's exclusive bundled software(i.e., iTunes) included free with your system. 12.1" TFT display: This may seem like a small screen if you compare it to it's Window's cousin across the street, but for most of us it suits just fine. This was one of features that almost drew me away from the iBook, but there is a 14" iBook available for those who really need it, but keep in mind that you will be adding a couple pounds. And this weight can really add up on your business trips or to and fro the office. Poly-carbonate plastic case: Yes folks, this is the same material used in bullet-proof glass. It's a no-brainer that this is what you want to buy your child who seems to be able to break anything. In fact, I've heard stories that these laptops have been run over by the family car and still survived, but I don't know if it's true. Floating Hardrive: The harddrive is mounted on special rubber shock absorbers. This will assure your data isn't lost or corrupted by the daily grind. All the necessary ports to talk and connect with other goodies, such as digital cameras and camcorders, printers, cable modems and dial-up , networks, scanners, headphones and even your TV set(optional adapter required.) Built-in microphone for voice command or recording. Free software(more on this later) Cosmetic Nifty little hook that magnetically secure to latch in base next to the mouse pad. When the lid is open the latch hides neatly into it's cubby-hole. The Apple logo is lit up on the outside of the case and Apple finally designed it right-side up rather than upside down as on the colorful clamshell models of yesteryear. There's a little button on the battery case that when pressed will tell you the status of it's charge. There are four little light, so you can only tell it's charge in quarters, but it's plenty handy in a cinch. Easy access to the airport card and memory holders. Just a turn of the screw and unhook two plastic retaining clips on either side of the upper keyboard. It's so simple to upgrade memory and Apple shows you how in graphic splendor. OK, now that I describe some of the obvious features of the iBook, I will delve into it's heart. That is the operating system itself. For those user who are use to the previous OS 9 or lower before, you must start from scratch. Apple has totally designed OSX from the ground up. You will still see a components that will remind you of your version, for example the tiny apple in the upper left-hand corner of the desktop, but many of the rules have change and in just about every instance for the better. I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news for you old user, but Apple basically want's you to trade in some of those old computers you've been holding onto for so long. Yes, Apple computer are so well built that many people haven't had to replace them for years. They just keep running and this presented Apple with the dilemma of losing their market share. Thank goodness for OSX with it's shiny aqua interface brought to us by quartz an amazing new technology that gives us the pretty graphics, anti-aliased lettering and the capability to turn any document into a pdf file to share with any computer anywhere. An example of Quartz would be when you move a window around on the desktop of OSX, you see a the window totally composed and not just an outline as you would see in OS9 for instance. The only downside of Quartz is that it's processor intensive and slows down the computer. Now a little about the other important components of OSX: Multi-threading and Premptive multi-tasking. With certain OSX programs, multi-threading gives you the ability to do more than one thing at a time. This feature will save you time. Premptive multi-tasking is even better because OSX assigns the necessary amount of processing power to the program at hand. No one program can hog more than it's share of the processor so you have a system that is more stable. Another neat feature of OSX that older users can appreciate it that memory is allocated and no longer fixed. The user no longer has to tell the computer how much a particular program should have, it's done automatically now creating a much more stable environment. The last major feature is memory protection. Simply put, if a particular program crashes you longer have to boot back up. The RAM isn't affected as in previous operating systems and you can go on using the computer as if nothing happened. All these feature added up give you greater reliablity, stability and ease of use. So much is going on behind the scenes in OSX, but this is deliberately done so to make it easier for you. There are still ways to get into the guts of the operating system, but why would you want to do that when you have such a simple and elegant interface to make your computing so enjoyable? That's the aim of OSX, so you might as well take advantage of it. The programs that come bundled are: iTunes: A program to organize your digital music. You can download off the internet and add songs to your library or you can import your CD collection. If you have a CD burner, you can make copies of CDs. You can make playlists, use an equalizer and even download music to Apple's own brand of MP3 player. iPhoto: Great and simple program for the digital photo enthusiast. It offers five areas in the program: Import, Organize, Edit, Book and Share. Let me just go over the highlights. OSX will recognize most camera types and automatically import when you connect it to the camera. You can also import in traditional ways. You can organize your photos by giving them tags and then recalling them later. The editing is fairly simple, but powerful enough to most of things you want. There's red-eye reduction and cropping functions. Depending on the version of iPhoto you have, you can also adjust brightness and contrast. There are also constrains so you picture will print in the correct format. This is useful if you don't want any of your picture cut off when you send it to the printer. Black and white and rotation is also offered. The Book section allows you to create an album that will later be sent to the Share section which will connect you to the internet where you can order a beautiful twenty page linen-bound book of your favorite vacation or perhaps family reunion. There are many formats to chose for your book. In the Share section, you can also print, although this option is available in any section, and you can order prints from Kodak. Finally, you can also create your homepage or slide show here. The last important piece of software that Apple wants you to use is called iMovie. To be honest with you, I have used this program far and few between because I don't have a digital camcorder. Comparing it to some of the other importing/ editing/ exporting programs out there (i.e., Sony's movie shaker,) this ones by far simpler and more elegant. It simply look nice. There are three areas to import and edit sound, so you can add a soundtrack, your voice and the track that was imported with the video. I've seen an actual demonstration of this and was amazed with the quality of the finished product. You can make a very professional piece of work with this program. There are effects such as floating titles, cross-fades and fadeouts that give your video that special touch. And the clincher is that it's easy to use like all the i software. Well, my friends, that's just an overview of this amazing laptop. There's so much more to it than I've delved into, but I wanted to give you my point of view and I hope it was helpful. One thing that I wanted to add was for those of you who are new to Apple computers, don't be thrown off by the operation system. You can still share files with your friends who use Window. You can still email them and send them your pictures. You can even network with Windows systems. If you have a lot of programs that are windows based, you can buy an emulator that will set window up on you Mac. There really is no limitation to buying a Macintosh and there are actually a lot of advantages. Please don't let faulty logic or thinking prevent you from considering one. Once you do buy one, and if you want further guidance in how it works and how to operate it more efficiently, I would recommend the book, "MacOSX: The Missing Manual/ The Book That Should Have Been In The Box," by David Pogue. Through his book I was able to write a more accurate review. And his book will guide you through unfamiliar territory with a sense of humor. Good Luck on your purchases. Solo. Update: Good news for iBook purchasers. Apple has just reduced the price of this model and added more power. They stuck a new G3 Power PC processor with 800 mhz along with thirty GB harddrive all for two hundred less than my posted price. Hmmm, i wonder if I wait another three months. Buy an iPod or Airport setup with the money you save. Or, use it toward the Gold Standard service called AppleCare(details on their site.) Also, you might find some bargains on the old model at retail stores. Hurry though, because they close out fast. I just had an encounter with their service today and I am pleased to say it went well. I only had to hear their recorded voice say, All technicians are busy...," five or six times and actually enjoyed the Peter Gabriel song. The tech was patient and thorough. He knew his stuff and had my baby working in thirty minutes. Bravo, Apple. Have your serial number and backup disks ready when you need help. Solo. P.S.: Visit my website in the near future. I'll be adding some info about this computer soon. Recommended Yes
iBook the best consumer laptop Dec 03 '02 Author's Product Rating Product Rating: 5.0 Ease of Use: Quality of Tech Support: Pros Size, weight, price, looks and OS X Cons Limited user upgrades The Bottom Line For most home users this is a nice balance of price and features. Full Review First a little background on who I am. I've personally used windows from version 3.1 to windows 2000. I have also used different versions of Mac OS. While I use windows 2000 at work I prefer Mac OS X. My first computer was an Apple ][. When Apple started with the original Mac I switched over to windows. When OS X came out I started playing with it as an alternative to windows xp. I now own a G4 tower. I have recommended the iBook to a few people. Both my mother and sister have purchased iBooks, solely on my say so. So you know if anything goes wrong , they will call me. To date my mom (computer illiterate), and my sister (former windows user), have had no problems with the iBook. Being I set up an Airport® network for them and administer it. they have been happy. The iBook is a pretty solid computer, but I also suggest investing the extra in AppleCare®. Notebooks take more abuse than desktops, by nature. So AppleCare® is a small, price to pay for the security it offers. First the Pros: The iBook is a decent size and weight for a notebook. Not too big and heavy, yet big enough to work on. There aren't may notebook that draw the looks like a Mac notebook. Being these are consumer level computers they have enough punch to do what the majority of users want. 12.1" iBook 4.9 pounds, 14 " iBook 5.9 pounds. They average a 4 hour 45 minute to 5 hour battery life, depending on use. You can also plug in an Apple keyboard and optical mouse, or any other USB Keyboard and mouse. The iBook has 2 USB ports, 1 Firewire® port, either a tray loading CD-ROM or Combo drive (DVD/CD-RW), Airport® ready (Airport® card $99 extra), 10/100 base T ethernet port, internal 56k (v.92) modem (modem cable included), power adaptor (wall plug) and an output for an external monitor (adapter included). You can pick up an iBook for as little as $999 these days (G3 700 MHz). From The Apple store http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore/ 700 MHz iBook $999.00 • 128 MB SDRAM built-in • 20 GB Ultra ATA drive • CD-ROM drive • Keyboard/Mac OS - U.S. English • ATI Mobility RADEON 7500 w/ 16 MB VRAM • Mac OS X and Mac OS 9 included • 12.1-inch TFT XGA display With the following software included Mac OS X, Mac OS 9, QuickTime, iCal, iChat, iMovie, iPhoto, iTunes, DVD Player (on Combo drive equipped iBooks), AppleWorks, Mac OS X Mail, Microsoft Internet Explorer, EarthLink (includes 30 days of free service), AOL, Quicken 2003 Deluxe, World Book 2003 Edition, Mac OS X Chess, Otto Matic, Deimos Rising, FAXstf, PixelNhance, and Acrobat Reader; Apple Hardware Test CD. My mom has been using hers for over a year without any problems, my sister has been using her's since June, again without any problems. The Cons: There are a few minor problems with the iBook in my eyes. They are 1) 128 MB RAM Should be 256 MB (12.1" models) 2) Lack of user upgrades, beyond the RAM and Airport® card there are no user upgradeable options. I would like to be able to upgrade the hard drive, without voiding the warranty. For anyone looking for a laptop to use in DVD editing, as a desktop replacement, or for a work machine I would suggest the TiBook (Titanium Powerbook). But as a consumer level computer, the iBook is a friendly dependable unit. OS X (Jaguar), makes the iBook a steal at the prices listed by Apple. Recommended Yes
iMac in your Backpack! Jan 11 '02 Author's Product Rating Product Rating: 5.0 Ease of Use: Quality of Tech Support: Pros small, light weight, sharp LCD, full size keyboard, many port connections, built in wireless antenna Cons no PC card slots, tray loading optical drive, no audio-in, no spanning-video -out, G3 The Bottom Line Small, light, most of the features of a desktop. This is my laptop of choice! Full Review The iBook is Apple's consumer targeted laptop. They have managed to pack a 1024x768 screen, an optical drive (CD-ROM or CD-RW/DVD), two USB ports, a Firewire port, 10/100 mbps ethernet, a 56K modem, external audio/video (composite or VGA, mirrored), stereo speakers, and wireless network access into a 11.2x9x1.35", 5 pound, shiny white chiclet. I purchased mine (500mhz, 66mhz bus, CD-RW/DVD, 12" screen, 256MB RAM) last May and it has performed beyond my expectations. Even after the latest model (600mhz, 100mhz bus, CD-RW/DVD, 12" or 14" screen, 256MB RAM) was released, my iBook has held its value. [OPERATING SYSTEM: MAC OS] Since the release of the 500/600mhz iBook, Apple has included it's new unix-based Mac OS X software with every model. I have been using Mac OS X as my main operating system since the release of version 10.1 and I recommend that any iBook owner do the same. You should have 256MB or 384MB of RAM for optimal performance, and pick up a couple of free utilities from http://www.unsanity.com/ to tweak the performance. (I've found application icons bouncing for you attention slow down system performance significantly on a G3) For those of you unfamiliar with Mac OS X, the unix based operating system features protected memory (applications that crash will quit themselves, not bring down the whole system) and a multi-tasking system which allows multi-media and interface processes to have priority over other actions, resulting in smooth MP3 and DVD/Quicktime playback. Another benefit of Mac OS X is the almost instant wake-up from sleep, essentially making your iBook as readily accessible as a PDA. [AIRPORT] One of my favourite features of the iBook is the option to equip it with an AirPort wireless card. I carry my iBook with me everywhere, and not only can I access the Internet from many of the main buildings on campus, I have found that other public locations such as the Starbucks coffee shops in Manhattan have access points as well. (for a fee, of course) If you find yourself tethered to a cable modem, or network port in your home or office, purchasing an AirPort base station for $300 (or another compatible transmitter) will allow you to set up your own wireless network with a 100 to 150 foot range. [RECOMMENDED ACCESSORIES] In addition to AirPort, I recommend you purchase a good set of external speakers, or some nice headphones to fully appreciate the output of the sound card. The internal speakers are a bit weak, but comparable to other laptops on t he market. If you are doing any audio input or output work, I recommend Griffin Technologies' "iMic", an analog USB audio interface. The iMic gives the iBook an audio in port, as well as an additional audio out port, both protected from signal noise sometimes present in internal audio hardware. And although the shiny white exterior is very strong, a thin, padded "slip case" to help the iBook survive backpack life is a useful, though hard to find, accessory. (Don't bother with those large notebook bags - they defeat the purpose of having one of the world's smallest full-featured notebooks) [PROBLEMS] A very durable unit, but I have had a few problems since I bought my iBook, which are easily fixed by a warranty repair: The trackpad button tends to double-click by itself if held down and pressure is released slightly, the screen seems a bit darker than a friend's newer model (I'll be looking into this), and some CD-RW discs when mounted under Mac OS X have produced a chain reaction of errors, requiring a reboot. (If you've had this problem, please contact me, I can't find it documented anywhere.) Also, the magnetic latch which keeps the unit closed has started to require a little extra push when opening the unit. (again a warranty issue) [HIDDEN FEATURES] When I spend a lot of money on a laptop, I like to be surprised, and this model has surpassed my expectations with a few unadvertised features: When connecting my iBook to my desktop machine via Firewire, both computers' hard disk icons appear on each other's desktops - instant, hastle free networking!, Speaking of networking, this model doesn't need a special cross-over cable to create a two-computer network - the ethernet port automatically switches polarity. And to save the best for last, like Apple's other laptop models, the iBook uses convection rather than a cooling fan to keep the temperature normal - most of the time! I was watching a DVD during the summer and thoughtlessly placed the unit on a blanket, preventing it's convection cooling to work properly. To my surprise, and amazement, an internal cooling fan started up and brought the temperature back down to normal! A definite improvement over the 466mhz model, which would just turn itself off when things got a bit toasty. Recommended Yes
Apple's New iBook Feels Like an Old Friend Jan 12 '02 Author's Product Rating Product Rating: 5.0 Ease of Use: Pros Chic, solid, extremely light, and highly functional Cons Like all Macs-- lack of software and peripherals The Bottom Line If you're a Mac fan, this is a no-brainer. If you're used to PCs, you may want to give the iBook a long, hard look... Full Review I bought an iBook as a Christmas present for my wife. Her previous computer had been a Macintosh Powerbook 1400c/133 with 40MB RAM (PowerPC 603e processor, 6.7 lbs, MacOS 8.0, 11.3" color screen, 40MB RAM). Needless to say, the iBook (500MHz PowerPC G3, 4.1 lbs, MacOS 9.2, 12.1" TFT XGA display, 128MB RAM, 10GB HDD, DVD-ROM/CD-RW Combo drive) is at once furiously faster, elegantly sleeker, and infinitely lighter than the Powerbook. Taking it out of the box, the translucent white iBook simply feels like a quality piece of machinery-- solid, with no loose parts that feel like they might break. Opening it up, the white keyboard (which, by the way, has excellent tactile feedback) and wide touchpad have a warm, familiar feel to them, as if the iBook is welcoming you home. Apple design and marketing has another winner in the iBook! I'll echo the sentiment of other users, though, when I say that the UFO-shaped power cable is one of the weaker points of the iBook-- it's largish, with a relatively thin, flimsy cord that's not even particularly long. I wouldn't be surprised if I had to buy another one of these at some point. The very first thing I wanted to check was whether the iBook could handle the full-screen Lord of the Rings trailer; the 1400c had not been able to handle Quicktimes beyond 160x160 in resolution. Happily, the iBook handled it perfectly; there were no visible skipped frames or other signs of distress, and the iBook's built-in speakers did justice to what must be one of the best trailers for one of the best movies of the year (I'm also a die-hard Tolkien fan!). The iBook came with Internet Explorer 5.0 pre-installed. I can't recommend IE5 on the iBook; it tends to hang for inexplicable reasons, especially if I have multiple browser windows open, and it's quite a bit slower than IE5 on my Dell Latitude CPx (P3-700). Here's a hint, though: install Netscape on the iBook. I installed Netscape v6.2.1, and Netscape on the iBook s definitely significantly snappier and more stable than IE5 on the iBook, rivaling my Dell in performance. The iBook's built-in DVD-ROM/CD-RW (4x4x6x24-- writes CD-R and CD-RW discs at 4x speed; reads DVD-ROM discs at 6x speed; reads CD-ROM discs at 24x speed) is a major plus, especially in such a light computer. Usually, with computers that are this light, you have tote around external drives and cables. Not so with the iBook! Here's another hint: You can hook up the iBook's display to a TV, and thereby use it as your primary DVD player. You need to get the iBook A/V out cable, which hooks into the headphone jack and splits into 3 RCA jacks. You can purchase it for $19.00 at the Apple Store; go to store.apple.com, and click on cables & hubs. The iBook snoozes and wakes up like a dream-- it takes only seconds to put it into suspend mode, and only seconds to wake it. When the iBook is asleep, a small round dot pulses with a bluish-white light on its front, giving you the soothing impression that it's dreaming happy dreams. The iBook is much, much quieter than my Dell Latitude. This may be an unfair comparison, since my Dell must be as loud as a 747, but the fact remains that I can barely hear the iBook when it's on. Web sharing is annoying and doesn't quite work properly. I had a 20MB PowerPoint file that I had to transfer from the iBook to the Dell; I tried to do it via web sharing, but I couldn't actually download the binary file. If you want a quick way to transfer large files between your PC and Mac, and you're reasonably computer-savvy, I highly recommend the freeware Hotline FTP Server for the Mac. Happily, the two built-in USB ports play well with accessories. My wife has a Palm m100, and I've been able to successfully get it to sync with Palm Desktop for the Macintosh using the KeySpan USB PDA cable. Also, I was pleased to find that I could just plug in my Logitech Optical Wheel Mouse and it mostly worked, with no additional driver installation. Initially, the wheel didn't work, although this was quickly fixed by downloading the latest MouseMan drivers for the Mac from www.logitech.com. Now, the scroll-wheel works beautifully; in addition, the right mouse button works the same way it does on a PC-- i.e., when you right-click a link, you get the familiar context menu. I like the iBook a lot-- I really do. Ultimately, though, the reason that I purchased the iBook was for the very practical reason that my wife was familiar with Macs, everyone else at the place that she worked used Macs, and all of the papers that she has been written have been formatted with Macintosh fonts. In addition, it does everything she needs it to do-- it allows her to browse the Internet, use Microsoft Office effectively, and telnet/ssh into her university's servers. Finally, the iBook is comparatively just not that expensive! According to most folks' best estimates, a G3 is approximately 33% faster than a comparable P3 at the same MHz rating, which would make a 500 MHz G3 roughly equivalent to a P3-700. Look around-- you're going to be hard-pressed to find a P3-700 that packs in this much functionality into such a sleek, stylish package at this price. Now, I just wish that I could find a PC that was this well-designed... Recommended Yes
The BSD User in You Jan 27 '02 Author's Product Rating Product Rating: 5.0 Ease of Use: Quality of Tech Support: Pros Ultra-portable, tough, great picture, small, tough!, built in ports... Cons Battery life, stock ram and tech support... The Bottom Line Buy it if you want the best consumer laptop out there. Don't buy if you want quality support Full Review This laptop has replaced my pc, my need for windows, my need for a seperate unix server. Basically this is a godsend to any developer. I purchased my laptop in June of last year, since then I have dropped it half a dozen times on very hard surfaces, had it fly up the aisle on a plane, when it landed and a slew of other things. Oh yes, did I mention I walk around with it in sub-zero weather? Yup, that's right this little thing is TOUGH! It has a great polycarb outer shell that protects it from just about everything. Sure, mine has battle scars, but it keeps on running and I can take it anywhere (literally) and rely on it working. I use this to prototype, develop and launch websites. I'm learning Objective C and getting a fast handle on the developer tools so I can start writing some cool software for this platform. When I ordered it, I ordered above stock model with the following options: 192MB RAM (later upgraded to 384MB) CD-RW 2 Batteries OS 9.1 (Booting)/OSX (Non-Booting) When I recieved it, it was amazingly fast in OS 9, top of the line.I wanted it for OS X. Since I was a PC User, I had to contact tech support to be educated in the process of booting it into OS X (not difficult). Called them, they told me, away I went. After this, I got one person who seemed as disgruntled as I was with some problems that came up. NOW ONTO MY SUPPORT QUALMS When Apple shipped the first few batches of these iBooks, some went with the wrong power adapters. So your iBook batteries would either charge for a bit off of the adapter or not at all. Now I spent almost five months trying to find the solution to this. We are talking over ten support calls, days of searching through support forums, several repair mailings and finally after all that someone had the idea it might be the power adapter. The Apple rep's were not only condescending, they were downright authortarian. It was either their way or no way. I refuse to purchase the AppleCare plan ($350 for an extended warrenty?) due to this. I used to work for an outsourcer of Gateway (I thought we were bad) and compared to Apple support. Gateway is the knight in shining armor. What's the moral of the story? If you don't know how to troubleshoot your own computer don't purchase an iBook, I went from PC to Mac, and I'm not going back. However I now know a metric ton (about five months of research) about how to fix mac's and their associated problems. If you don't, be wary. Otherwise if you're a guru, and can learn on your own go for it. Apple, has a few lessons to be taught to it, by the cutthroat PC market, one of them is support. If you have bad support, no one buys your product except guru's and fanatics. Overall am I happy? Yes, however I cringe even thinking about having to deal with Apple Support again. Recommended Yes
I came, I saw, iBooked Feb 11 '03 (Updated Feb 11 '03) Author's Product Rating Product Rating: 4.0 Ease of Use: Quality of Tech Support: Pros Tiny size with big appeal. Cons Occasionally overheats, and product finish is not what you'd expect from Apple The Bottom Line All in all, a very handy bit of kit for the travelling computer user. Full Review I bought one of these little devils about a year ago for work and play. I wanted something that I could easily carry round to show work on, but also something to play on when I got home in the evenings. With the iBook I have both. This is a great machine for most computer work except some graphic heavy stuff due to the limitations of screen resolutions it can run (you can never run this iBook at greater than 1024x768). For word processing, some design work, web building and other administrative tasks though, this is great. The best feature is by far the portability. This is a tiny machine in terms of weight and size, even though the processing power packs a mean punch. If you're going to buy this though, I would thoroughly recommend getting the CD/DVD combo drawer, as one of the standard features that come as part of the deal is the invaluable iTunes. MP3 lovers, you will want to marry this application. I watch DVD's on it and burn audio CD's without problem. The unit does have a habit of overheating sometimes, and the fan that automatically kicks-in is very noisy. Battery life is excellent - I can get about 5 hours word processing on a full charge, or about 2 hours doing processor intensive work such as Photoshop or Flash. The screen quality is amazing - far better than any PC, but MAC users will already be used to this. (please note, my "amount paid" is a conversion from 1,200 UK Pounds) Recommended Yes
Moved from PowerBook to IBook Oct 13 '02 Author's Product Rating Product Rating: 5.0 Ease of Use: Quality of Tech Support: Pros Size, style, simple to use Cons Needs 256 mg RAM standard The Bottom Line Small, cool and easy to use. Technology that is transparent--this is what all providers should aim for. Full Review When my ancient PowerBook needed replaced due to age, I looked at what I used the laptop for. As a supplement to my desktop unit, the laptop needed to offer many of the same features--but would not be used as heavily. Size, portability and ease of use were also important. The iBook has been all of that. It worked just fine out of the box. The Airport set up was simple. The screen is a bit small, but it does not seem to be an issue. I use .MAC, so sharing files and images has been quite easy. All hardware (cameras, printers, scanner) have worked well. The size and weight continue to be a big plus. This is truly a "personal" computer. I am finding that I grab it and sit in a comfortable chair--instead of working at my desk. Probably not the computer you want if you have lots of heavy duty stuff and graphics to do..but it makes a nice portable version of your workstation. College kids should like it---cool design, does music and graphics well. Network stuff is quite easy. Recommended Yes
When I started looking for a computer for school, my first thought was to buy a desktop system. I knew I wanted an Apple computer, but I couldn't decide which model to get. Then someone suggested I look at the iBook...I laughed. Now who's laughing? I decided that it couldn't hurt to just look at an iBook because I had convinced myself that it was not what I was looking for. I was completely wrong. This sleek little computer has the power of a desktop, and comes with some features that Apple has yet to put into the rest of its computer line. That would be the DVD/CD-RW Combo drive. I have yet to use the CD-RW feature of the drive, but I have played many a DVD. While it doesn't always play them flawlessly (It's a computer, not an entertainment system.) it does quite a job. It depends on how you have the system's energy saving features set up as to how well the DVDs play. The picture is wonderful, but the speakers do sound a little hollow, somewhat like an alarm radio. Don't let the G3 processor scare you away. I know this sounds crazy, but the 500 Mhz G3 seems faster than some of the G4s that I have used that were running at 433 (I think). I've installed Photoshop and Illustrator and it runs both of these programs just fine. I was worried about having such a small screen, but that has yet to be a problem. I really don't notice it at all. There are, however, some annoying things about this computer. It comes with iTunes, a program that allows you to create CDs, and lets you import music to your hard drive, but it tries to connect to the internet every time you put in a CD! I thought I found a way to disable this crazy feature, but I was wrong and am still looking. It also comes with iMovie, but with a "10" gig hard drive, you really don't have much room for importing video. (The hard drive ships with almost 7 gig of available space.) The computer does get hot. Very hot. For some reason the left side, near the trackpad, gets super hot if the computer is on very long. The bottom also gets quite hot. The other thing I don't quite understand is the keyboard. It's designed so you can pop it out and ad RAM and an AirPort card, but there is nothing holding the middle in. Whenever you type from the middle of the top row, or use any numbers, it feels like the keyboard is going to fly apart, and I've read that some people have had keys pop off that wouldn't go back on! Overall, I think this computer is a great choice. The features and ease of use make it an ideal choice for a student, but it's good for anyone. If you're used to a mouse, you may want to buy one to use with the computer because the trackpad can be hard to use sometimes. (I have a mouse for using Photoshop, for example.)
Another success triumph for Apple. Their iBook has been one of the better surprises that they have ever had. The company managed to learn a thing or two from previous products, mainly the PowerBook G4. Th iBook is a straightforward looking business person's laptop. One with plenty of power and get up and go features to allow any successful person to want to log on and tune out the world. How did they do it? First off you swap out the older processor with a newer 600MHz version. Slap in a nifty DVD/CD-R/CD-RW combination drive and beef up the storage to the tune of a 20GB hard drive. They added another log on the performance fire by massaging the system bus work to boost the speed from 66 MHz to 100MHz. Apple managed to drop some weight from the earlier models {down to 4.9 pounds -12 ounces for the power supply} and zip up the look by creating a stylish, elegant white polycarbonate and silver magnesium case that looks cool, but still feels tuff. My unit had come with the standard 128 MB ram  but I immediately bumped that up to the maximum of 640 MB (RAM is goo  MORE RAM is MORE GOOD, ancient Computer Tech saying). In fact, the architecture of the G series processor and motherboards improves performance almost logarithmically as the amount of RAM is increased. Almost all of the connection ports are still on the left side (the AC jack is on the right). These include 56K modem, 10/100BaseT Ethernet, a FireWire port, two USB ports, a Kensington lock port, and a miniature monitor output port. {This port will connect to a standard monitor with the use of an adapter}. The audio and video port serves as headphone or speaker jack as well as direct output to a TV or video projector (again with an optional Apple A/V cable). I am still missing the much-needed PC Card slot, but I have found that by using either USB or Firewire accessories that my expansion capabilities are not too limited. In fact, I expect that I will be using an external DVD and/or CD-RW burner via Firewire for speedier copies than what the internal drive can do. The keyboard is still the same. One of the few things not needing improvement. The display is powered by an ATI Rage Mobility chip setup, providing superior and clean 12.1-inch LCD viewing. Incorporating the 8 MB AGP 2x - ATI RAGE MOBILITY 128 graphics card into the system, does this. The architecture of the Apple makes the requirements of a greater quantity of video RAM unnecessary. My wife requires a bit larger screen display than I do, and the swapping between modes is quick and simple. With the incorporation of - AGP 2x - ATI RAGE MOBILITY 128 I all ways managed to find myself opening up any new toy before the warranty expires. I do this in order to ascertain how easy the toy is to repair or upgrade. The iBook is a cinch to upgrade, just loosen up one screw and the keyboard pops out. RAM upgrades are easy enough for my six year old girls; two screws, a RAM shield, pop in more RAM. I was pleased that Apple supplied both Mac OS 9.2.1 and OS X 10.1. I like the 10.1 version more due to the improved stability and performance. And if you like to embalm yourself into the Unix universe, then the OS X is just what you need. webserver installed for webhosting. The networking on the iBook (and any MacOS X system) is the most comprehensive around. You'll be able to connect to just about any network -- even those Windows networks. Apple also included Apache, AppleWorks, iMovie, iTunes, Mail, Micro's FaxStf, Internet Explorer, Outlook Express, and Netscape Communicator. For those of you in need of written material, Apple supplies two manuals, one for the iBook and the other for Mac OS X 10.1. Most people who buy this machine will do so mainly because of the digital sound and video capabilities. And that is probably more than enough to turn a few heads that would never had considered a Mac before. But those of us who have been down the block a time or two will see what this machine really is. This is the poor mans Corvette, the frugal persons Calphalon. This little package will stun you with performance and capabilities, while still allowing you to retain enough of an income to make the house payment, AND take your spouse to dinner! One of the areas that Apple needs to pay attention to in the future is the poor battery performance. Apple states the iBook's battery life is a lengthy 5 hours. I have had no luck obtaining the posted result. I found that excessive use of the DVD swamps the battery and kills it after 2 hours of use. I can not truly compare the iBook to other non-Apple laptops. That would be like comparing lobster bisque to chicken noodle soup. The iBook does not have the blistering speed that its big brother does, but it performs very well against more pricey (and less capable) Intel based laptops. Apple's other area of concern should be their warranty. The one year is an industry standard, but the 90 days of toll free technical support is not long enough. Add to this the $49 charge per support call after the 90 days and you have a sharp slap in the face. The three year AppleCare warranty extension is costs a whopping $249. I have found that Apple's Web provides sufficient material and information {documents, software updates, and discussion forums} to allow an old cpu tech like myself to keep my system running. The bottom line is that unless you like to spend money, or absolutely have got to have state of the art performance, then the iBook may be the perfect laptop for you. It is speedy, light, solid, and has a beautiful display and plenty of sex appeal.
Years ago I used to be a staunch Macintosh user. I was a big user when System 7 was around and used Macs all the way up to System 8.5. My last Mac was a PowerMac 7200, but I had other Macs also -- PowerBook 180, Duo 230, PowerMac 6100, and my beloved Mac LCIII. But, as things happen the creaks and cracks in the age old MacOS were finally showing with System 8.5 and 9. I left the Mac community for a bit -- I've always been a Mac and Windows user. So what convinced me to step back into the Mac arena? A Unix shell. Plain and simple, that's what got me back on track for a Mac. My friend Darrell showed me how I could open up a Unix shell with a iBook 500 a few months ago and I was astounded. He also showed me that Perl was installed by default -- that was all that it took. I was sold, I knew I needed a new iBook for MacOS X! So, what does the iBook have? This is the iBook 600. It has a PowerPC G3 processor inside running at 600MHz on a 100MHz bus. The 100MHz bus is something important here because that's the speed at which the processor moves data between the different components of the machine (most importantly the RAM). In previous iBook incarnations the bus speed was 66MHz, but Apple increased this with the iBook 600. The iBook comes with a default of 128MB of RAM. This is a great amount of RAM to have if you're working with MacOS 9. But, if you're going to use MacOS X (which is the future of Macintosh) then you'll definitely want to boost the RAM in the machine. 128MB of RAM is the minimum amount of RAM that will run MacOS X. 256MB is a decent number to be at if you won't be running more than two or three applications at once. I put in an extra 256MB of RAM to bring the system up to 384MB of RAM and the system runs fast and smooth. The only other upgrade choice is to put in a 512MB SO-DIMM of RAM, but that's a bit of overkill. Looking at the utility "top" in the command-line I still have a lot of free RAM left after opening many applications (MS Word, Internet Explorer, LimeWire, Fire, and Mail). The key word here when you are thinking about MacOS X is "RAM." The more the better with MacOS X. The iBook 600 comes in all different combinations. These combinations are of the optical device that is installed into the system and also one for the screen size. First the optical devices. You have the choice of having this system with: CD-ROM drive, DVD-ROM drive, CD-RW drive, and DVD-CD/RW drive. I went with the combo DVD-CD/RW drive so that I can watch DVD movies in bed and also burn CDs to move data around to different machines. The CD/RW drive is a 4x4x6x24 drive, meaning that it burns CD-R media at 4X, CD-RW media at 4X, reads DVDs at 6x, and reads CDs at 24x. This is plenty fast for burning audio CDs of MP3s and burning data for backups. If you're doing a lot of burning, this maybe a bit slow and you can opt to get one of the other choices (CD or DVD) and then add a FireWire CD-RW drive (which burns at a lot faster speed). The combo DVD-CD/RW drive, as you may have guessed, is the most expensive of the choices. The list is in order of cost from least expensive to most expensive. The other choice that you have with the iBook 600 is the screen size. Apple just released a 14" version of the iBook 600. The innards are all the same -- though you'll get a faster DVD-CD/RW drive inside (it's a 8x8x8x24 drive) -- the only difference is the screen. Why didn't I choose the 14" screen over the 12.1" screen? Easy, they both run at 1024x768. If the 14" screen could run at a higher resolution it would have been a no-brainer. But because the 14" screen runs at the same resolution as the 12.1" screen, there really is no benefit of paying $300 more for a mere 1.9" of diagonal screen display. Talking about the display, it is one clear and bright display. My work notebook is a Sony VAIO and it has a nice display. The iBook display is on par with the Sony display, though I might have to say that the iBook display is a bit brighter at the highest brightness setting. My only gripe about the display is that though there are special function keys to adjust the brightness, they don't seem to work that well. I wish also that MacOS X would be able to detect the difference between the iBook being plugged-in and running off batteries in respect to the display brightness. On the Sony VAIO it automatically adjust the screen brightness down when the notebook is unplugged from the power, this is not the case witht he iBook. The "new" Macintosh is being sold as a digital hub for all things digital -- movies, music, pictures, etc. And I must say that this is true! The DVD player that is included with MacOS X works wonderfully. It includes a fullscreen mode that lets one watch movies as if the iBook were a nice 12.1" portable DVD player. iTunes is a wonderful jukebox that lets you rip your CDs (don't steal music!) and catalog them. iTunes is really good when you think about the offerings on the Windows side -- in that there is nothing this well done on the Windows side that is free! iPhoto is a wonder in itself. The program has an interface that is unique -- it lets you zoom in and out of a page full of thumbnails. If you want an overview of all your pictures you can zoom out. If you want to look at a few, you can zoom in -- all the way up to a single picture. This is an ingenius interface. I have not had the chance to try iMovie yet because I don't have a FireWire capable DV camera. On the iBook I don't run MacOS 9.x at all. I'm strictly using it for MacOS X because it will be the future of the Macintosh line of computers. The OS is stable and solid. Yes, there is a learning curve when one comes from a previous MacOS system, but it's not too bad. And the trade-off for that learning time is a rock-solid operating system. When I was looking at the iBook I was worried that the G3 600MHz chip inside would be too slow for MacOS X. I'll have to report that the chip is just fine -- it's really not the chip speed that makes the difference, but the amount of RAM that you have installed. The one other thing that I added to the system is an AirPort card so that I can take advantage of the 802.11b wireless network that I already have installed in my house. If you have an 802.11b access point already installed in your house, then the AirPort card is a must. The best thing about the AirPort card is that it is all internal. The antenna is built-in to the iBook itself. So, unlike my Sony VAIO with an 802.11b card in the PC Card slot and a big antenna hanging out of the notebook, the AirPort is clean. To upgrade the machine is a snap. All you have to do is loosen up one screw and take off the keyboard. To install RAM you loosen two more screws on the RAM shield and then pop in the RAM. Put the shield back on and that's it. For the AirPort, just slide it into the AirPort slot (which is above that shield). I did the RAM and AirPort upgrade in less than 30 minutes. If you're a heavy Unix user -- like me -- then MacOS X has its benefits for you. The Aqua interface for "regular" home users is nice, but if you like the command line then it is there too! All the goodness of BSD Unix lives under that beautiful Aqua interface. Along with this you'll be able to let people SSH into the machine. There is also an FTP server for file transfers. And the iBook has the Apache webserver installed for webhosting. The networking on the iBook (and any MacOS X system) is the most comprehensive around. You'll be able to connect to just about any network -- even those Windows networks. The iBook comes installed with a slew of software to get you going. This includes the very useful AppleWorks which includes a word processor, spreadsheet, database, drawing, painting, and presentation applications all in one. Very useful to start off with. The iBook also comes with some games (like Cro-Mag racing and Bugdom) to play. On the MacOS 9.x side you'll also get a fax program. This machine is ready out of the box to be a productive machine. Thinking about an iBook? Don't think, just get one. It's a light machine that you can carry around with you to do all the stuff you need. This is by no means a high powered machine though. If you are going to do serious movie editting or Photoshop work then I would suggest one of the PowerBook G4 machines. The iBook is a medium speed machine that is great for word processing, web surfing, and emailing. If you want to do gaming, go get a Playstation 2. Get an iBook 600, you won't regret it, especially since Apple just dropped the price on the 12.1" DVD-CD/RW combo system by $200!
As a long-time devotee of Macs who had been in PC purgatory for an extended period, I was delighted to be able to return to the fold. I had just switched jobs to a facility that is Mac-centric and, because I spend a lot of time on a train for my commute (2hrs./day) I was able to justify the purchase of a laptop for myself to handle basic work on the way to and from work. I looked at both the iBook and the PowerBook and compared features and then assessed what functions I would need during my commute. I decided that rather than spending the additional $500-$1000 to buy the PowerBook, I could easily function with the iBook for 99% of what I needed. The added feature of the ComboDrive (CD-RW/DVD-R) allowed me to archive files on a removable media (at the time, the Powerbooks were not yet shipping with the combo drive). It has easy access to several ports (2 USB and 1 firewire) as well as having a built in 10/100 Ethernet port and 56k modem. There is a jack out to an external monitor (or projector), but it needs an adaptor (provided) to convert to the standard input jack on most monitors. There are a few drawbacks to the computer, minor but easily workable. First and foremost is the monitor size (12.1") which can really stress the eyes after a period of wordprocessing. I have used the powerbook and that monitor size is much nicer (the only problem is that the computer is longer than the average laptop, so you will have a problem finding a case without buying the Brenthaven unit designed for it). Another problem, that I read about in a review and have found to be true, is the keyboard. At the top of the keyboard (numbers and function keys), the attachment to the frame of the computer has a bit of play. As a result, when you are typing, the keyboard "squishes" under your fingers a bit. This can be a bit disorienting when it comes to touch typing (and has slowed me down a bit). I haven't heard of anyone breaking a keyboard as a result, but you can easily buy a replacement keyboard from apple. One other problem (that tends to be endemic in the "slimline" laptops) is that the screen and keyboard sit very close together. This can result in a scuffing of the screen where the tops of the keys bump against the screen -- this problem is amplified in the powerbook (as it is a bit thinner). One work around is to keep the thin sheet of foam that comes packed between the two. I use a small piece of chamois (that serves as a gentle screenwipe). The last problem with this unit is the RAM. It ships with a (dismal) hard-wired 128mb. You can upgrade (with only one free slot) to a total of 640mb (which is definitely worth it). The other thing I can't quite grasp is why this still has the G3, especially in light of the new G4 iMac. Overall this is a good, solid, stable (with OS X) laptop. With the increase in OS X native software, Macs are the way to go. Besides, it looks so much cooler than any of the grey wintel boxes on the train.
 I was heading off to college this fall, and I finally weedled my parents into getting me a laptop. Apple has always been strong in the educational market, and with the release of the updated iBook, this fact has never felt truer. In my search for the perfect notebook, I weighed in the features that would be most important for my needs: - A word processor (hey, that midterm paper isn't going to write itself) - Easy connection to the Internet (Doh! I gotta get some ideas and information for that paper first!) - Good music software (A little Foo Fighters helps maintain my sanity) Well, the iBook definately covers each of these bases and much more. It comes packed with Appleworks 6, a powerful suite of office-like programs from your basic paint to slideshows to the obligatory word processor. But more demanding users may opt for Microsoft Office, and for you lucky college students, you probably can get the academic version at your campus bookstore for $5. Best thing, it's compatible with the Windows version so you can communicate with your non-enlightened friends in an effort to lure them away from the dark side. Surfing the web is a snap; in fact the computer will guide you through it right after you turn it on for the first time. Finally iTunes, the music program included on all macs is a blast. It is aesthetically appealing, with one the coolest visualizers I've ever seen. It organizes all your music, from the ripped tracks from roommate's cds to the new tunes you downloaded off of the Gnuttella network (hey, not that I'm advocating it), you're wired and good to go. UPDATE: with the newly released iPod mp3 player, audiophiles have the most compelling reason ever to make the switch to macs. This player's groundbreaking, but I won't ramble on about it, check if epinions has that up yet. Now despite my gushy acclaim for the iBook, there are caveats. After only a few days of use, I found numerous scratches all over the case. It is made out of a very smooth polycarbonate that is tactilely appealing but scratches like no other. On the white case, they're hardly noticeable, but on a $1500 investment, it certainly conjures up a saddened whimper. Although I find no problem with the 12.1 inch screen - it attributes to the portability - it might take some people some adjustment and consequently, some squinting time. The resolution on the LCD is very good, and it is bright and crisp, perfect for watching DVD movies. I'm not going to bother outlining all the technical details- if you are reading this you've most likely done some research. The Bottom Line is 10 gigs is a tight squeeze if you love music and plan to do iMovie editing (going with the 10 gig hard drive was probably my biggest mistake). Expand your RAM to 256 MB if you want to run several programs simultaneously and with more zip. I bought a 500 Mhz iBook, but you should consider the 600 mhz one, especially since the bus is faster - 100 mhz instead of 66. The thing that might bog you down the most in deciding whether you should make this buy will probably be the fact that this is a mac. Truth be told, you do sacrifice some convenience with the iBook. A lot of software and games are not compatible and the selection is limited. I dislike the fact that the computer doesn't have a floppy drive - sure, you could email the file or burn it on a cd (if you have the CD-RW or combo drive) - but the use of floppies still haven't really diminished. Sure the iBook has its drawbacks, but in the end for me, it came down to the personal touches Apple puts on all its products, from the pulsating sleep light to the glowing Apple logo. After all, a laptop is the most personal computer of all, and the fact that everything about it tells you that it was a labor of love from the folks at Apple, really makes getting that paper written a lot less of a daunting task.
I had been considering purchasing a laptop computer for some time, when I heard that Apple had updated the iBook lineup. Here is a quick summary of the new features: The iBooks now feature the ATI Radeon Mobility 7500 graphics chipset; the lower-end iBook has 16MB VRAM, the other iBooks have 32MB. The lower-end iBook has a 700Mhz G3, while the higher-end iBook has an 800Mhz G3 processor. The prices are lower than ever, starting at $999 for the 700Mhz iBook. I decided to go with the 800Mhz iBook, since they really offer a lot for the $300 more they cost than the 700Mhz iBook. The 800Mhz iBook gives you more speed, a CD-RW/DVD combo drive (instead of the CD-ROM in the 700Mhz iBook), 32MB VRAM instead of 16MB, and the same lovely case as the latest iBooks have had. The 700Mhz $999 model has a different case; it is white plastic everywhere, whereas the nicer iBooks are metallic-looking on the inside and white with clear lexan on the outer case, just like they have been for some time. I also decided to go with the 12.1" display, since it has the same resolution as the 14.1" display. The only real benefit to the 14.1" iBook is that it includes a higher-capacity battery, which offers at most 1 more hour of use. The benefits of the 12.1" iBook are the following: weighs 1 lb less, 1.5" narrower, slightly more than 1" less deep, costs at least $200 less, and it has a more sturdy feel than does the 14.1" iBook. Noticing that all of the iBooks have 128MB RAM permanently attached to the motherboard, I chose to populate the singe memory expansion slot with a 512MB SO-DIMM, which cost me $100 online (about $100 less than Apple sells it for). Having read reviews on the IBM Travelstar 40GXN hard drive, I bought the iBook from an online store that offered the Travelstar as an upgrade (http://store.powerbook1.com/index.html). They charged me $50 to switch up from the standard 30GB model in the iBook, plus $39.95 for installation (included RAM and Airport card installation too). This hard drive really is great; it has 5400rpm instead of the usual 4200rpm, and has an 8MB buffer instead of the usual 1-2MB. Anyways, I was of course delighted to get the package, since Apple always does an amazing job of packing things. The iBook package is a keeper. The iBook includes a power adapter, extension cord for the adapter, 6 foot phone line, and a VGA-output adapter. International plug kits are available from Apple, and composite/SVideo-out adapters are available for about $15. Setup was a complete breeze with OS 10.2.1, which is included as the default operating system. The iBook feels as sturdy as a rock. Much more professional-feeling than any PC laptop I've worked on, including the Pentium4 Lattitudes and Inspirons from Dell. The iBook is basically dead silent when operating. If you are in a library or something, you might hear the faint noises of the the hard drive, but then if you don't get a 5400rpm drive like I did, you might not hear it at all. Performance is amazing. Quake III gets about 50fps in 1024*758 mode, just like Apple says. Wolfenstein plays very well at 1024*768, as does Alice. Everything is very snappy, and load times are not bad at all with the awesome hard drive. DVD playback - of movies - is perfect. Never choppy at all, and beautiful. The ATI Mobility 7500 is pretty much taking care of DVD playback; I enabled the CPU monitor, and watched CPU utilization while moving the DVD playback window around on the screen. The movie continues to play smoothly, and the CPU hovers around 60% utilization. The 12.1" screen is beautiful, and I prefer it to my 17" Viewsonic monitor. DVD playback - of interlaced material - is in need of deinterlacing. I found out the other night, while trying to watch a Simpsons Season 2 DVD, that interlaced DVDs show yucky interlacing artifacts in Apple's DVD Player, both in Mac OS 9 AND Mac OS X. I really hope Apple fixes this soon, since the ATI Radeon Mobility 7500 has hardware support for DVD deinterlacing as I understand. Typically, TV shows are 30fps interlaced, while movies are 24fps non-interlaced, so beware of buying TV DVD boxed sets until Apple address this problem - that goes for X-Files, Simpsons, South Park, Star Trek, Monty Python's Flying Circus, and so on... :( Divx 5 full-screen playback is great, unless you try playing back really huge Divx movies such as 1024*768, which can get choppy. 640-wide Divx movies seem to play back fine. Battery life is wonderful as well; when I'm just word processing, I get about 5 hours of battery time. When I'm on wireless networking, browsing the internet and downloading things, I get about 4 hours. When I'm playing Wolfenstein, I seem to get about 3 hours, but I'm not positive (time flies). I'm playing with Virtual PC 4.04 right now, under OS 9. Windows 2000 feels just fine, like I'm using an older Pentium II or something, only the hard drive is much faster than an older Pentium II would have had. Browsing the net using IE6 feels just fine. I downloaded SP3 from outside the library at my college, since the library was closed. I was getting about 200KB/s on the built-in wireless. I'm only bothering with Virtual PC for kicks, and so I can shock my Mac-hating friends by running Windows full-screen on the iBook. Battery life is about the same as a PC laptop would have when running VirtualPC, funny enough - 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Just for kicks, I took my PC's USB keyboard, optical mouse, and 17" monitor, and attached them all to the iBook. You have to make sure to plug the mini-VGA adapter in all the way. Anyways, everything just worked immediately. No plug-n-play delay or beeping as with WindowsXP. I then purchased the $20 mini-VGA to composite video/S-Video adapter that Apple makes, and proceded to hook up my iBook to my friend's 27" TV. Once I had figured out to plug the darned thing ALL THE WAY into the iBook, the resolution switched to 800*600 automatically and the TV lit up with Mac OS X. I switched the resolution to 1024*768, but the TV really did look better at 800*600, so I switched it back. Additionally, the S-Video looked much cleaner and sharper than composite video. Anyways, for $20 you can turn your iBook into a portable DVD-player for use on mom's TV - cool. Considering that this iBook has 640MB RAM, CD-RW/DVD, a really great 40GB HD, an internal modem, 10/100 ethernet, internal wireless networking, a top-notch 32MB graphics card, firewire, 2 USB ports and VGA out, I think that $1600 was a total bargain. When you consider the features, size, weight, looks, and battery life, there is simply nothing even remotely as good in the Windows laptop world. When you consider that the primary operating system, OS 10.2, is built on an open-source Unix kernel, Windows is looking downright shady. In conclusion, the new iBooks are faster, cheaper, have better CD burning performance (16x), about twice as good of a graphics card, and a better operating system (OS 10.2.1, aka "Jaguar") than ever. I may use a Windows computer at home, but I'm using it less and less; Windows XP really feels junky compared to OS X. Don't get me wrong - my Windows computer is fast and reliable, but I've not really touched it since getting the iBook...
The price and the hype finally got to me. I wanted a laptop computer, and the ibook was the cheapest in the store, so I bought it. Here are some of my conclusions: 1) Mac OS is not all that much easier to use than windows. In fact, it is less convenient in some cases. I find it harder to navigate and find my files. 2) The ibook comes with only 128 megs of RAM. If you use a Windows machine, you can go almost anywhere for a RAM card to upgrade. However, once you enter Club Mac, you need to hunt down a RAM card, or buy it from Apple's web site. I made a special trip to Manhatten to buy the card at a store called Tekserve. At Tekserve, you are issued a number, depending on what kind of help you need. You then wait until your number is called. It took me about 1 hour to get my RAM card. 2.5) Putting in the RAM card is not as easy as it looks in the instructions! You need a VERY small Phillips screwdriver with a sharp point at the end to open the RAM shield, which is located under the keyboard. Then insert the card, replace the RAM shield, insert the tiny screws back in, screw them in gently, and allign the keyboard just right, and snap back in place. I had help with this, not being a do it yourself type by nature. 3) Apple is getting rid of their free itools web stuff. Now if you want to participate in .Mac (Dot Mac, the new itools) you will need to pay $100.00/yr! They can keep their FTP space and @mac.com email address! 4) Battery life is pretty good, especially if you adjust down the screen brightness. However, to get the battery charged, I have to wiggle the charger plug around until it turns orange. Why should I need to wiggle it? It should just start charging on contact. The charger gets HOT, especially if you are using the ibook while charging. I do not recommend doing this. The ibook also gets pretty warm while using it. Overall, while I am mostly satisfied with this computer, I do not understand what all the hype is about. iphoto has crashed on me several times, and locked up the machine. The email program that is included is terrible, and crashes every time I use it. Luckilly, Mozilla comes with its own mail program, which i now use. I suppose lifetime Mac users could give me a very good reason as to why this computer only has a delete button, which works like a backspace button on a Windows computer, and no way to delete from a position in front of a letter or word. However, to me, this is a major pain. I suppose I am the Grinch of the Mac world, but I do not need bouncing icons in my dock. Animation is now off, thank you very much. I can also live without the icons ballooning up when I run my mouse over them. Oh yes, if you are a fan of light up apples on the back of your machine, making you an Apple billboard if you use the machine in public, then by all means, get one of these.
IBook 500Mhz searchers....dont' sell yourself short. There is a BIG difference between the 500 and the 600 in the Ibook, and I will give you the specifics to make the right choice.....which is the one I made. I have seen the 500's going for pretty cheap (about $1000 to $1200), and I really was looking to get into the Mac market. As a former PC user, I was getting sick and tired of the instability of a product called Windows. I really liked 2000, because it was headed in the right direction, but then I saw XP and realized I had used my last PC OS. I sold all of my PC's, and wanted to use the funds to get what I really wanted.....a portable, multi-function, multi-tasking system that did not run windows. Mac seemed the likely choice. My boss owns a 550 Mhz TiBook, so I was really curious about one of those. However, my research led me to believe that this choice had more drawbacks than just the price....there were issues with the DVD front loader, and it's ability to take a hit was rebuked by other reviewers. I just cold not justify an extra $600 for an extra 3 inches of screen, so I looked into the new Ibook 600Mhz. The most noticable difference in the 600 from the 500 is the speed jump. 100Mhz usually isn't a noticable difference, but looking under the hood gives you an idea why it is considerably faster. The bus speed was increased from 66Mhz in the 500 to 100Mhz in the 600. This easily gives you a 15-20% increase in performance. The 600 supports both PC 100 and PC 133 SDRAM, which also increases the speed of the applications you run (this is related to the fact that the bus can support the peripherals running at 100Mhz). The 600 supports up to 640 MB of Ram, giving you enough memory to run critical apps smoothly. My advice....spend the extra bucks and get the 600. The only drawback to the Ibook in general is that the screen is a 12.1 " TFT, as compared to the TiBooks massive 15.2 " viewable screen. At only 4.9 pounds, this is one of the most powerful notebooks I have seen that weigh less than 5 pounds. I support many notebooks at work, and there is just no comparison between this notebook and all of the P III Ghz notebooks. The Ibook 600 leaves them all in the dust.....and they hate the fact I have FireWire!
 I'm like the guy in the tv ad---a film maker, started with apple, switched to windows for 5 years...and two weeks ago, came back to mac. I got the 12.1 inch Ibook G3, and I think I can be helpful here for those in windows world considering the move. Here's my best shot: -First, this is far more fun to use. Youdon't need a manual, it all just works just by doing the obvious things. -I hate that it is bright white...wish it was metal, but I love that it has virtually no switches, buttons, lcd indicators, blah blah. You turn it on, you use it. The bad thing is the touchpad. Mine is very erratic, sometimes freezing, sometimes releasing, sometimes the cursor actually just dissapears. I've grown to attach a wireless mouse. -The PHENOMENAL thing, well worth the switch---is that this thing works instantly without configuring, setting up, doing much of anything. I even installed Road Runner cable modem in my apartment, plugged the mac in, and it simply worked. I didn't need one of the 3 cd roms that supposedly were required to be installed. Same with two different printers and a digital camera. Plug and Play is the truth here, nothing like what windows puts you through. -The software is truly fabulous. At first I was thinking "oh, jeeze, now I have to go pay $500 for microsoft office", but you don't. Appleworks 6 contains everytthing you need and it works intuitively. Word processing is just like MS Word. Mail works even better. Itunes is totally amazing, the absolutely best music manager on earth. Just wait til you plug in an Ipod and instantly/automatically syncs up. -Little quirks that annoy: The usb ports are both on the left side, meaning if you plug in a mouse, yoiu have to wrap the cord around theback of the computer. I use a wireless (which also plugged and played without pestering loading any software). The ac adaptor plugs in on the right, 1/8 inch from the dvd drawer, so the cord often gets in the way. The ac adaptor itself is smaller than most and has a handy wrap-around device for the cord that goes to the computer, but they totally neglect a place to store the cord that goes to the outlet. It becomes an unruly mess. -The computer comes with 128 megs of ram, which you really need to upgrade immediately. There is one open slot for more ram. I bought a 512 ram card for $79 over the internet, giving me a total of 640. Might as well when it's that cheap. Apple charges $200 for the same card. -IMovie is fun for simplistic video editing. I'm using Final Cut Pro which rivals a $40,000 avid system. Battery life is not 5 hours. I don't know where they came up with that number,but it's a total lie. I have done 3 hours and 20 minutes max. Finally, tech support. This is a 100% full fledged joke. You cannot even find a phone number to call. You have to use this ridiculous "question" system to search for answers to questions, few of which even relate to the topic. And when you try to go deeper and really need help---they have the audacity to send you to a page where you can order extended warranties. Apple really should be ashamed of this dismal support. If you want to see online support done well, go to fujitsu.com where they have live chat with technicians. Anyway, I am enjoying the experience, and I'm finding mac a lot of fun to learn and put through its paces. At $1299 , it's a real bargain, and I feel that I can recommend this laptop higher than any I've had to date, including the Fujitsu 2100 and the Thinkpad x23.
Apple has once again proved that they are in the drivers seat when it comes to innovation. The iBook is a great inexpensive choice for a dependable, small-enough-to-be-packed-around, laptop - for Mac users and PC users alike. History I been a PC user since PCs first hit the scene - ever since the 80's. My only experience with Macs in general was back in college in the early 90's - and that was only to get the occasional paper done. In short, I have no bias towards Apple or Macs in general. In fact, I've probably had a negative bias against them since they were so unfamiliar. With the release of OS X and its high marks, I decided to give a Mac a try. I was looking for a laptop with enough power to get things done, but small enough to be 'lug-able' to business meetings. The iBook, it turns out, was the perfect choice. Pros The Price: I found a used iBook on eBay, so my expenses will differ from yours, but iBooks are a great deal, in my opinion. Why spend $2000 on a Dell or a Gateway when you can get a much slicker machine for less? A 'fully loaded' iBook runs around $1500 new. The basic model can be found for closer to $1000. I ended up finding the 'loaded' model on eBay for $1100. You mileage may vary. The Operating System: As I mentioned, I'm normally a PC user. I am very proficient in Windows and have been using Win9x for years. The switch to OS X was not hard. Once you get used to main menubar at the top of the screen (individual windows typically don't have their own 'imbedded' menubar on a Mac), navigation is pretty easy. The new 'dock bar' is pretty cool, and the overall look is very stylish. I was slightly disappointed that the basic colors and 'look' can't be customized very much. Surprising - but the default look couldn't get much better anyway. Window scrollbars and 'hotkeys' are also a little different. But this isn't a review of OS X, so let's move on. Let's suffice it to say that my iBook runs OS X very nicely (384 Megs of RAM). The 'Look': You can't beat the look of the all-white iBook. It just looks superior to other laptops. The whole thing folds into a box about the same size as an inch-thick sheet of standard paper. The first-generation iBooks with the clam-shell design looked like toys to me. This new version looks like a marvel. Co-workers definitely notice when you crack open the beautiful iBook at a meeting. The 'Feel': I'm used to desktop machines, so I figured I would have trouble dealing with a compact keyboard and a trackpad. Both have caused me little regret. The keypad is very nice for a laptop (it 'gives' a little too much in the center - oh well), and the trackpad is fine compared to other laptop trackpads. I actually don't even use an external mouse, which makes traveling with the iBook easy. The Accessories: My iBook came with the Combo Drive (combination CD reader, CD burner, DVD player). If you can afford this accessory, get it. I've played CDs and DVDs without problem and burned several CDs. While the CD burn speed isn't great, who needs to burn a CD in 2 minutes? I only need to burn CDs once in a while. If it takes 10 minutes, who cares? The screen is a beauty. Crystal clear and vivid. Some complain that it's too small. I agree that real estate is lacking when I've got a lot of applications open, but that's where the dock bar comes into play. The screen size is a limitation of the overall laptop size. I'm OK with a small screen because the overall size of the laptop is perfect. For ports, the iBook comes with a built-in 56K modem. For us non-highspeed-internet customers, it works fine when dialing up my ISP. The built-in ethernet port connects easily and flawlessly to my company's Microsoft-based network. Two USB ports and a firewire port ensure that it's easy to add external components. Applications: I've got Microsoft Office X on the iBook, so I'm covered when it comes to office and productivity applications. If I wasn't able to run Office, I'd be disappointed. I'm not much of a gamer, but it seems that most quality games eventually become available on the Mac. Cons Hard Drive: I wish my iBook came with a larger hard drive. 10 gigs just isn't very large these days. The new ones come with 15 gigs (I believe). I suppose I could upgrade someday. Speed: OS X is a state-of-the art OS and takes a decent machine to run it. 98% of the time I'm not disappointed by the speed the iBook manages OS X and the applications. Occasionally there's a definite lag - but that beat the occasional crash on a Wintel machine. Summary PC users, take the plunge. You'll be happy you did. The iBook is a truly viable alternative - and a better alternative in many ways - to the Windows-based laptop.
This machine, like most Apples, really is a snap to use right out of the box. It comes with a phone cord and an AV-out cable for use with a projector or the like. In less than 5 minutes I was online and surfing the web. Right out of the box, no problems. Having had this machine now almost a year, I can truly say it's exactly what I needed. I use it for just about everything. At the time, it probably should have come with more memory out of the box, but that was easily remedied, since memory prices were so low for a while. More memory helped, especially with OS X taking up so much of it. From what I've read, the machine is not going to be easily upgradeable; however, I can't see this being a problem anytime soon for me. The screen may seem small, but the resolution makes up for that. It feels like I'm working on a much bigger screen. And the color of the screen is brilliant. The machine itself looks really cool. It's a long way from my old 1400c I used to have. Additionally, that machine was a brick. This iBook is incredibly light! I felt like I was breaking my wrist every time I picked up my 1400, but this iBook is just the opposite. The outer white surfaces of the machine do tend to get scuffed a little, but this is a computer after all. One is probably going to be a little more careful with it than a duffel bag. Since I got my iBook I've gotten a digital video camera and a digital still camera. Both are a whiz to use with my iBook. No drivers needed for either cam. And with iPhoto, Apple's digital photo software, one literally just has to plug in their cam and the machine immediately recognizes it, fires up the software, and is ready to go. I really do like this machine. I'll probably keep it longer than any other machine I've had.
"Describe everything that comes in the box with this laptop." Out of the box was a 700 MHz iBook G3, power adapter, monitor out cable, installer CDs, some software, some manuals. Preinstalled is iPhoto, iTunes, iMovie, and Appleworks software suite, "Did the laptop work perfectly out of the box?" Worked perfect, simply needed to setup a user account, nothing to install. I was ripping songs, importing photos, surfing the internet in ten minutes. Never easier. "Does it have a fast processor but little RAM or some other weakness?" Comes with 128 MB of RAM standard and I had 256 MB preinstalled, there's only one RAM slot. Processor is fast enough to play Unreal Tournement and Warcraft III with decent framerate. Photoshop ran as well as my G4 desktop. How upgradeable is this laptop? Not too upgradeable. I can switch the 256 MB RAM with 512 MB when it gets cheap enough. Add in a Airport card later on. I don't think the processor or harddrive is upgradeable, maybe later on. Ignore the specs for a moment and describe how fast the laptop feels. It is fluid, runs OS X perfectly. Internet loads faster on this machine than on my desktop even though the connection is the same. I can't explain it. Is the laptop light and easy to travel with? Yes, this is a light laptop, I am used to nine pound monsters, the iBook has some heft to it, about as heavy as a medium side text book. The small size lets me throw it in my backpack every day with no worries.
 Truly, you can not find a group more devoted to their computers than Mac addicts. Still, there must be a reason. Haven't you heard the joke where if Microsoft built cars, "Apple computers would make a car that was solar-powered, twice as reliable, and five times as fast, but would run on only 5% of the roads"? The "dual-USB" iBook is the next generation of Apple's original iBook which, though eye-catching, was panned by many as being too heavy and unnecessarily large given it's 12.1-inch screen. Taking styling cues from the Powerbook G4 Titanium, Apple has abandoned the candy-colored design scheme for a more understated elegance. The changes are more than just skin deep, however, and with the recent revision, the iBook is even better! The new iBook sports a 600Mhz G3 processor with a 100Mhz FSB (improved from the initial 500Mhz/66Mhz), a standard hard drive of 12GB (upgraded from the original 10GB), a 12.1-inch TFT screen with resolutions up to 1,024x768, two USB ports, one Firewire port, built in Tbase10/100 Ethernet, and 56K internal modem. It also sports an 8Mb RAGE Mobility 128 graphics chip; an improvement over the candy-colored iBooks. All that in an under-5 lb package. Apple recently announced a larger version with a 14-inch screen, but same resolution; this should really be viewed as something of a change for the worse. One of the best aspects of the iBook is it's portability, so increasing its size without increasing the "desktop size" is an improvement most can do without. The iBook also comes in a variety of configurations. You can choose a basic CD-ROM drive (on 500/66 machines only), a CD-RW, a DVD-ROM, or a combo drive. Obviously, these get progressively more expensive, although with price drops across the board, the iBook is more affordable than ever! So the real questions is, what should make YOU go out and buy one? Let me weight the pros and cons... THE PROS: 1) Form factor! Apple has a corner on the market when it comes to style. How many laptops elicit double-takes? The iBook sure does. And not in the same way the old technicolor toiletseat models did. The best part is that Mac owners go so far as to customize their iBooks with paint jobs and other mods. But that's neither here nor there... 2) It's petite! The iBook's footprint is, literally, barely larger than an 8.5x11 sheet of paper. It slips right into my book bag between my magazines and my papers. And with a weight of under 5 pounds, it weighs considerably less than most college textbooks these days! 3) It's stable! I don't even want to get into the nightmares I've had with Windows ME on my HP desktop. And now that I've upgraded to Windows XP, I've traded up for a completely different set of problems. I've had my iBook for the same length of time, and I have had a mere FRACTION of the headache. "Solar-powered, twice as reliable, and five times as fast" indeed! 4) The price is right! Apples are becoming more and more competitively priced everyday! You can get a rock basic iBook 500/66 for under a grand, but I'd recommend springing for at LEAST the DVD-ROM if not the combo drive. Even so, the most expensive model (which boasts a screen 2" bigger diagonally) is well under the $2000 mark. 5) FIREWIRE! Only the high-end PC's boast built-in Firewire, or IEEE 1394 as they like to call it. Macs have them standard, and if you've ever tried to move a big load of info over USB, you'll know how helpful it is to have a transfer speed of up to 400Mbps. That's up to 30times FASTER than USB. Oh, and did I mention that Apple invented it? I can't comment on tech support because I've never needed them. Then again, isn't the BEST tech support the one that you never need? THE CONS: 1) Not the speed demon the Titanium PowerBook is. As much as I love the iBook, I have to admit that its speed is sort of middle-of-the-road. In other words, don't plan on doing any heavy duty data-crunching or 3D modeling on this. The G4 PowerBooks are much better suited for that sort of thing. BUT they are also bigger, heavier, and much more expensive. Still, with the bump up to 600Mhz and a 100Mhz system bus, they're moving in the right direction. For those of you looking to buy, the speed increase is very minor, but definitely noticeable. Think about what you need before you buy. If you go for a 500/66 you could save a couple hundred bucks in the process! 2) Apples come at a premium. In a world where PC's are a dime a dozen, Macs do come at something of a premium. It's pretty minor, but RAM upgrades are a little more expensive than those for PC's. Why? Beats me. 3) Being a swan in a world of ducks. Let's face it, Bill Gates is a marketing genius. Windows drones are everywhere. What that means is that you'll have to look a little bit harder for software or compatible drivers. You'll have to do a little extra work to take full advantage of a built-for-Windows LAN and print to network printers. Hey, does anything worth fighting for ever come easy?
